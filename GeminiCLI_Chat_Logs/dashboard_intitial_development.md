## USER 🧑‍💻

I have a potentially token heavy project. Please bear this in mind and ensure regular compaction is carried out and that pre compaction context saving is done. 

1. @peloton-presentation/peloton_dashboard_prompt.md is the prompt to follow. however now I believe a single html file will be too big, multi document website is acceptable as long as we have index.html to load to github pages. 
2. @peloton-presentation/analysis/peloton-board-presentation.md  is what the board presentation will be built around, where the dashboard prompt references [INSERT KEY INSIGHT FROM SLIDE 3 ABOUT RISKS] use this document for context. 
3. @peloton-presentation\analysis\notebooklm\** is the folder with *all* of the important source data, ignore the sources folder entirely. Once the primary dashboard pages are created then we can enhance using the additional data in these files. This is also where you will find the relevant source material for source material viewer. 

Any questions before you plan?

# <a id="src-main"></a> FY2025 Strategic Outlook and Financial Performance Targets

Based on the Q1 FY2025 earnings call transcript, management provided the following specific guidance and targets.

### **1\. Full Year FY2025 Targets**

Management reiterated some prior guidance while raising targets for Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.

*   **Total Revenue:** "Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at **$2.4 billion to $2.5 billion**"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** The outlook "remains unchanged at **49%**"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** Management raised the guidance range by 40million.LizCoddingtonstated : "WeareraisingourFY^{′}25adjustedEBITDAguidance...to ∗ ∗240 million to $290 million\*\*"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** "We are also raising our free cash flow target to **at least $125 million** an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance"[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** The guidance range of "**2.68 million to 2.75 million** remains unchanged"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Paid App Subscriptions:** Management lowered this guidance by 20,000 subscriptions to a range of "**550,000 to 600,000**"[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Churn:** Management expects "average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to **increase modestly year over year**"[[Source 3]](#src-3).

### **2\. Q2 FY2025 Expectations**

For the second quarter, management provided specific ranges reflecting seasonal trends and increased marketing spend.

*   **Total Revenue:** "**$640 million to $660 million**," which reflects a sequential increase due to holiday hardware sales[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** "**2.84 million to 2.86 million**," reflecting a "sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint"[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **Paid App Subscriptions:** "**560,000 to 580,000**," reflecting a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** "**46.5%**," which reflects an expected sequential decline "as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment"[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** "**$20 million to $30 million**," reflecting a sequential decline mainly due to "higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Churn:** Management expects the churn rate to "**slightly improve sequentially** in Q2"[[Source 6]](#src-6).

### **3\. Cost Restructuring Milestones**

Management confirmed they are on track to meet the savings goals announced in the May 2024 restructuring plan.

*   **Total Run-Rate Savings:** Interim Co-CEO Karen Boone reiterated the goal of "delivering **over $200 million of run rate cost savings** by the end of fiscal year '25"[[Source 7]](#src-7).
*   **Payroll-Related Savings (Completed):** CFO Liz Coddington confirmed that as of the end of Q1, they have "actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver **over $100 million of annualized run rate savings**"[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **Additional Efficiencies:** Management noted they are realizing some savings "faster than we anticipated" and finding "additional cost efficiency through **reductions to media spend** that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals"[[Source 8]](#src-8).

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

I truly cannot wait to officially welcome him to Peloton at the start of the calendar year. Turning to our financial results. I'm extremely pleased to share that we are reiterating our fiscal 2025 financial goals today, which include: first, aligning our cost structure to the current size of our business by delivering over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal year '25 from our cost restructuring plan announced in May 2024. Second, improving our unit economics across all products and sales channels in pursuit of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and meaningful free cash flow generation.

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

# <a id="src-main"></a> FY2026 First Quarter Earnings Performance and Revised Outlook

Based on the **Q1 FY2026 earnings call transcript** (dated November 6, 2025), management focused primarily on the results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 and the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.

The transcript does not contain a retrospective comparison of **FY2025 full-year results** against the guidance given at the start of FY2025, as that period had closed in the previous quarter. However, management provided extensive details regarding their **Q1 FY2026 performance** against guidance and updated their **FY2026 full-year outlook**.

### 1\. Q1 FY2026 Performance vs. Guidance

Management reported that the company exceeded expectations on most metrics for the first quarter of FY2026.

*   **Total Revenue:** **Beat.** Reported 551million ∗ ∗,\\, outperformingthehighendoftheguidancerangeby ∗ ∗**6 million**[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** **Beat.** Ended with **2.732 million**, exceeding the high end of guidance by **2,000**[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** **Beat.** Reported 118million ∗ ∗,\\, whichwas ∗ ∗**18 million above** the high end of the guidance range[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** **Beat.** Generated **$67 million**, which management noted was "significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** **Missed.** Reported **51.5%**, which was **50 basis points below** the guidance of 52%. Management attributed this miss to a specific one-time charge: "Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs"[[Source 4]](#src-4).

### 2\. New Guidance Provided for FY2026

In the Q1 FY2026 call, management **raised** their full-year guidance for Profitability (EBITDA), Gross Margin, and Free Cash Flow, while maintaining their Revenue outlook.

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

Liz Coddington Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

# <a id="src-4"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 4)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Subscription revenue decreased $28 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, lower content licensing revenue and lower ending paid app subscriptions, partly offset by used equipment activation fee revenue, which was introduced in late August of fiscal 2025. Total gross profit was $284 million in Q1, a decrease of $20 million or 7% year-over-year. Total gross margin was 51.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points below our guidance of 52%. Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs this quarter, in addition to $3 million we accrued in the prior quarter, representing a total estimated impact of $16.5 million. Excluding this $13.5 million charge in Q1, total gross margin would have been 54% or 200 basis points above our Q1 guidance.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

# <a id="src-6"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 6)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

# <a id="src-7"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 7)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

# <a id="src-8"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 8)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

*   **Deleveraging:** The company expects to make meaningful progress deleveraging the balance sheet through FY2025 and beyond, specifically mentioning the paydown of **~$200M** in convertible notes due in February 2026[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 20]](#src-20).
*   **Restructuring:** The "2025 Restructuring Plan" (announced Aug 2025) is expected to be substantially implemented by the end of Fiscal 2026, targeting **$100M** in run-rate savings[[Source 21]](#src-21)[[Source 22]](#src-22).

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Really helpful. And maybe one just follow-up on Connected Fitness gross profit, gross margin sort of reaching that double-digit sort of milestone for the first time is a great hurdle to clear, but we think that you still are always away from where you think this can go over time. Any context as to sort of where you see the upper band on Connected Fitness product gross margin and the levers you have there to sort of pull those higher going forward?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So our improvements in Connected Fitness gross margin are due to -- there's multiple dimensions to that. Some of that is mixed into some of our more premium products that do have a higher gross margin and then some of that is also just being more optimized in how we offer discounts. And then we've also made some pricing changes.

So we can continue to pull all of those levers over time. And we do expect our gross margins can -- that they can continue to expand. I'm not going to give you a specific target for that, but we know that there is more opportunity to expand them over time. And we do expect for the remainder just to clarify, for Q3 and the full year for fiscal '25, at least, we do expect to maintain double-digit Connected Fitness product gross margins primarily because we are shifting toward those higher-margin products and being really disciplined about our promotions.

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

# <a id="src-12"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 12)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

Subscription gross margin was 68.6%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. Total operating expenses, excluding restructuring, impairment and supplier settlement expenses were $230 million in Q1, a decrease of $30 million or 12% year-over-year, reflecting the continued progress we've made in rightsizing our cost structure as well as a reduction to advertising expenses in Q1 ahead of our hardware portfolio refresh announced on October 1. We are on track to achieve our target to deliver at least $100 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2026. Sales and marketing expenses were $67 million in Q1, a decrease of $15 million or 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by decreases in acquisition, brand and creative marketing spend as well as a decrease in retail showroom expenses. As of the end of Q1, we had 7 legacy retail showrooms remaining.

Please refer to Annex A for descriptions and reconciliations for each above non-GAAP financial measure (Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA) to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

In Fiscal 2026, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies and managing the business toward profitable growth, while investing in product and content innovation to drive long-term growth. Our goals include to:

*   achieve at least $200 million of Free Cash Flow;
*   achieve at least $100 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of Fiscal 2026;
*   launch new product and content offerings focused on holistic wellness, including a portfolio of refreshed hardware products;

We do anticipate our full year fiscal '26 product Connected Fitness product gross margins to increase year-over-year. And then in terms of a long-term target, you mentioned double digits. Our goal is eventually to be in around the 20s range, and we intend to make progress towards that in the fiscal year. I do want to point out, though, as we've talked about on many prior calls, that we will continue to make trade-offs between gross margin and marketing spend based on the LTV to CAC efficiency that we see. Now Peter, did you want to talk a little bit -- I can talk about marketing.

# <a id="src-18"></a>Source: q1 2025 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 18)

We've become much more disciplined in our media spending and a lot more focused on where are those qualified growth audiences. So, all of these areas, I'm really impressed with what Lauren and her team have done and the way they, I think, set up Peloton as part of this broader effort at the company to create a solid foundation of sustainable and profitable growth. So, you can expect that to continue.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

So, on the question around the LTV to CAC and the path back to getting to that 2x to 3x. So, our goal is to get to that 2 to 3x range, ideally closer to 3, we do have some work to get there. We're not quite there yet. And we have these near-term levers that we are focused on that are under our control.

And then as Chris was talking a lot about investing in future growth. So, the pricing changes that we've made and the reduced promotional activity that you saw in Q1 are way for us to improve our gross margins. So, we made progress on those in Q1 and as we go into Q2, we will still have promotions over the holidays, but we will continue to make progress on our LTV by improving our gross margins over time. And ultimately, our goal is to get to where we have significant positive gross margins across all products, all channels, and all markets.

This campaign resonated well with men. In Q2, 42% of Connected Fitness Subscription gross additions were men, a 280-basis-point increase quarter over quarter and 240 basis points increase year over year. In addition to advertising more toward men, our marketing efforts were also focused on demonstrating the full value of the Peloton membership through better education of our extensive offerings. Among the Latine and core female audiences exposed to our holiday campaign, we observed a lift in awareness of non-cycling modalities like walking, running, yoga, and high-intensity interval training.

We also saw an increased in the Latine audience that would consider using Peloton, which is a leading indicator of future intent to purchase. Alongside reaching new audiences and introducing additional disciplines to our members, we continue to make progress on improving our marketing efficiency which we measure from a lens of our LTV to CAC ratio. While our LTV to CAC remains in the range of one to two times, we have made progress year over year toward our target to reach at least two times and ideally closer to three times. Our Q2 LTV to CAC was roughly 15% higher than Q2 fiscal 2024.

Similarly, our net leverage ratio, defined as gross principal debt outstanding net of cash and cash equivalents divided by trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 1.1 in Q1, down from 7.5 in Q1 of last year. We believe we have more cash on the balance sheet today than we need to run the business and are evaluating opportunities to optimize our capital structure over time. In February 2026, roughly $200 million of 0% convertible notes will come due, and we intend to pay them down at that time. It's also worth noting our $1 billion term loan has a 1% call premium through May of 2026. We are mindful of the timing of when this call premium expires as we evaluate our options. We expect a refinancing to deliver a lower cost of capital and more flexibility to our capital allocation strategy.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

Upon full implementation, we expect the 2025 Restructuring Plan to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2026.

We may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the Restructuring Plans, and implementation and transition _costs may be greater than expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K._

And third, continuing to make strategic investments in innovation to enable Peloton to return to top-line growth in the long term. This includes product development in both software and hardware features, refining our marketing strategy to attract new audiences, as well as evolving our content offering to deliver more diversified, engaging fitness experiences. We believe these efforts will delight our current members and attract new ones to our strong and loyal community. Our Q1 results were strong, exceeding our guidance on all key metrics, which Liz will discuss in greater detail.

Progress on cost reduction efforts are reflected in our profitability metrics. We are proud to report Q1 results, which include $13 million of GAAP operating income, $11 million of free cash flow, and $116 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our results also highlight the continued strength of our category-leading connected fitness subscription business, which has over 6 million loyal members, 2.9 million connected fitness subscribers, 586,000 app subscribers and over $1.7 billion of annualized subscription revenue was 68% gross margin. I am thrilled to see our cost reduction efforts materialize in our financial performance to date.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

We ended the quarter with 2.9 million paid connected fitness subscribers, reflecting a net decrease of 81,000 in the quarter. This exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10,000 subscribers. The main driver of our subscriber outperformance was slightly favorable churn versus our expectations as a result of fewer subscription pauses. This favorability was partly offset by slightly softer gross additions than we expected.

Average net monthly paid connected fitness subscription churn was 1.9%, slightly favorable versus expectations and in line with the prior quarter and an increase of roughly 40 basis points year over year. As a reminder, our net churn performance from the year-ago period included a one-time benefit as a result of elevated subscription unpauses in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, following elevated pauses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 in response to our original bike seatpost recall. We ended the first quarter with 582,000 paid app subscriptions, reflecting a net decrease of 33,000 in the quarter. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 12,000 from both higher additions and better-than-expected average monthly paid app subscription churn, which was 7.1% in the quarter.

In the first quarter, we've continued to scale back the amount of media spend dedicated to support growth in paid app subscriptions to maximize media efficiency. As we continue evolving our app with software enhancements, such as personalized plans and Private Teams, and developing new app offerings like our Strength Plus beta. We may elect to invest more in-app media if we see signals that suggest we can accelerate growth of app subscribers efficiently. Total revenue was $586 million in the first quarter, comprising $160 million of connected fitness products revenue and $426 million of subscription revenue.

connected fitness products revenue was down 12% year over year due to lower hardware demand and subscription revenue was up 3% year over year due to content licensing revenue from lululemon and Google Fitbit. Total revenue was above the high end of our $560 million to $580 million guidance range, primarily due to higher subscription revenue as a result of higher paid connected fitness and paid app subscribers than we expected, as well as slightly higher connected fitness products revenue. As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonally lower period for hardware sales, which is reflected in the revenue mix of 27% connected fitness and 73% subscription for the quarter. Total gross profit was $304 million in the first quarter, an increase of $18 million or 6% year over year.

This quarter, we recognized $8 million of impairment and restructuring expense, of which $5 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exit. The cash charges consisted of $3 million in exit and disposal costs and professional fees, offset by a $0.5 million net benefit from lower severance and other personnel costs. We also recognized $24 million of supplier settlements due to accruals in the first quarter related to settlement of a dispute with a third-party supplier.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

The progress made so far shows in our profitability where we achieved meaningful improvements in Q2. Both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow increased roughly $140 million year over year. This enabled us to make meaningful progress deleveraging our balance sheet with net debt decreasing over $280 million or 30% year over year. All this is to say that while we are working on our long-term growth strategy, for fiscal '26 and beyond, our financial goals for fiscal '25 and continued discipline toward improving gross margins, reducing operating costs, and deleveraging our balance sheet are and will remain top priorities for me.

Now I'll turn it over to Liz to discuss our Q2 results.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. We are pleased with our second quarter results as we exceeded our guidance on key metrics and continued to make meaningful progress improving unit economics and profitability. We also made progress on our marketing objectives by improving LTV to CAC year over year and elevating Tread with Target audiences. We ended the quarter with 2.88 million Paid Connected Fitness subscription reflecting a net decrease of 21,000 in the quarter.

Second, we continue to see a slight headwind to churn as a result of subscription mix shift toward the secondary market, which has a higher churn profile than subscriptions that purchase their hardware directly from us or our channel partners. Favorable churn was partially offset by lower gross additions due to slightly lower hardware unit sales, a higher mix of Tread portfolio sales, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products, and longer delivery times for Tread+ units that delayed subscription activations until Q3. Secondary market activations were in line with internal expectations and represented roughly 40% of total gross additions in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with 579,000 Paid App subscriptions inclusive of Strength+ subscription, reflecting a net decrease of 4,000 in the quarter.

This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 9,000. Total revenue was $674 million in the second quarter, comprising $253 million of Connected Fitness Products revenue, a decrease of $66 million or 21% year over year, and $421 million of Subscription Revenue, a decrease of $4 million or 1% year over year. Total revenue was $14 million above the high end of our $640 million to $660 million guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenue from both segments. The holiday season is a critical period for Connected Fitness products revenue as Q2 has historically represented over 40% of annual hardware unit sales.

Research and development expenses were $60 million, a decrease of $20 million or 25% year over year, primarily driven by lower employee related and contractor expenses. In Q2, we recognized $20 million of impairment and restructuring expenses, of which $17 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exits. The cash charges consisted of $3 million of severance and other exit and disposal costs as we continue executing on our restructuring efforts.

Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the second quarter, which was $28 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $140 million improvement year over year. We generated $106 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, an improvement of $95 million quarter over quarter and $143 million year over year, and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $829 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $107 million quarter over quarter. We continue to make progress toward deleveraging our balance sheet as net debt reduced $281 million or 30% year over year.

Liz Coddington Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

# <a id="src-10"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 10)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint.

Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

# <a id="src-20"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 20)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton Fiscal Strategy and Guidance Adjustments 2025-2026

Based on the earnings transcripts provided for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026, Peloton management has frequently adjusted guidance. The trend across these periods shows a consistent pattern of **raising profitability and cash flow targets** due to cost discipline, while revenue and subscriber guidance has been more mixed or narrowed.

Here is the breakdown of instances where guidance was raised, lowered, or declined.

### 1\. Instances where Management **Raised** Guidance

Management raised guidance in three consecutive earnings calls reported in the documents, primarily driven by accelerated cost savings and improved unit economics.

### 2\. Instances where Management **Lowered** Guidance

Management lowered guidance in only one specific instance within the provided transcripts, related to App subscriptions.

*   **Q1 FY2025 Call (Oct 31, 2024):**
    *   **Metric:** FY2025 Paid App Subscriptions.
    *   **Decrease:** Lowered by **20,000 subscriptions** (New range: 550k–600k).
    *   **Reason:** Management made a strategic decision to limit media spend for the App while investing in product development to improve the member experience before spending to acquire new users[[Source 11]](#src-11).

### 3\. Instances where Management **Declined** or **Withdrew** Guidance

Management explicitly declined to provide specific guidance on certain metrics, citing uncertainty or internal policy.

*   **Future Engagement Benefits (Q1 FY2025 & Q2 FY2025):**
    *   **Declined to Guide:** Management declined to incorporate potential upside from software innovation (such as "Teams" or personalized plans) into their financial guidance.
    *   **Reason:** The timing and magnitude of when these innovations would meaningfully impact engagement and retention were deemed "uncertain"[[Source 11]](#src-11)[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Specific Churn Guidance (Q2 FY2025):**

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

# <a id="src-10"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 10)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

It was up 40 basis points year over year. As we discussed during the last quarter earnings call, we expected Q1 net churn to be up year over year due to a few reasons, including the following: slightly worse overall retention from our 1P and 3P subscriber base, which we've talked about, mix shift toward secondary market subscribers, which do have a slightly lower retention than our first-party subscribers. And then we also had the impact of a one-time benefit in Q1 of fiscal '24 related to higher subscription on pauses following elevated pauses in Q4 of fiscal '23 related to our original bike seatpost recall, and we did not repeat that benefit this year. As we move forward and look at Q2, we do expect our churn to improve seasonally compared to Q1 and we do expect that improvement would likely be a bit muted though compared to quarter-over-quarter improvement that we saw in fiscal '24, again, because of those two headwinds that I mentioned about the slightly worse retention in our overall subscriber base and that mix shift into secondary subscriptions, which do have that higher churn profile.

So, overall, for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our churn to continue to be higher year over year because of the mix of subscribers from the secondary market continuing to grow but we do expect churn to remain below 2% for the whole of fiscal 2025. I do want to point out though, and we've mentioned this before, that our guidance doesn't assume any potential upside to subscriber retention as a result of the software innovation initiatives that Chris talked about earlier, which we believe could positively impact member engagement and ultimately, retention over time. And the reason we haven't incorporated those is because the magnitude and timing of those benefits is uncertain at this point.

# <a id="src-13"></a>Source: q2 2025 earnings transcript.md (Citation 13)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

And so with the passage of time, that benefits our churn. The second thing is looking at engagements. Peloton is that rare brand that makes you healthier the more you use it. And so one of our goals is to get more people using our product more and we're pleased to see here some growth in our engagement levels in terms of the average monthly workout time for ending Connected Fitness subscription if we look at that on a year-over-year basis.

So we've got a healthy customer base. We've got healthy usage. As I mentioned earlier, we have strong NPS scores, and that all adds up to healthy churn. Liz maybe you want to provide a little more color?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

I can provide a little bit more color on the outlook. I think you were asking a little bit more. We're not -- we don't guide specifically to churn, but we can -- I can tell you that in Q3, we do expect our average month -- net monthly paid Connected Fitness churn rate to remain relatively in line with Q2. And then just on a full-year basis, we do continue to expect our churn rate to increase modestly year-over-over.

# <a id="src-14"></a>Source: q2 2025 earnings transcript.md (Citation 14)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

You talked a lot about improving churn. I was wondering, is it fair to assume that this better-than-expected churn, which is probably not as much of a surprise to you as to us, given the efforts you've taken to get there? My question is, how should we think about potential price increases in light of improving churn? It seems like you feel better about churn today than you did three months ago. First, is that a fair assumption? Second, how should we think about sort of price increases in the subscription business in light of improving churn? Then I have a quick follow-up.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Arpine, thanks for the question. And we obviously -- we feel good about the churn that we just reported, and Liz just talked you through a little bit about how we're thinking about it for the rest of the year. With regard to pricing, to state the obvious, pricing is a powerful lever with every change up or down, essentially dropping straight to the bottom line. So we're taking a hard look at pricing alongside everything else in our business.

As a reminder, in Q1, we took steps to improve our unit economics by taking up the price of our rower in North America, and we also raised prices for Bike and Bike+ in our international markets. This holiday season, we also improved our hardware unit economics by reducing the number of days that we were on promotion and by structuring our promotional strategy to better align with the margin profile of our products. So all of that added up to greater discipline, as well as some terrific learning opportunities for us around pricing. I think a question that might be in everybody's mind is around subscription pricing, and we know how important subscription pricing is to our members, as well as to the performance of the business, and we won't take any actions there lightly.

So beyond what I've shared so far, that's about all we have to say today, but we'll share more about pricing when we're ready to.

Arpine Kocharyan -- Analyst

Wonderful. Great. Peter, I was wondering if you could share your initial impression of where your see low-hanging fruit in terms of further cost optimization. Do you feel that that's first in hardware COGS versus more in sort of opex and the obvious sort of G&A that you've talked about before in terms of being higher than it's supposed to be? Where do you see that low-hanging fruit as you sort of look at the business with fresh eyes?

_Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024_

Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 decreased $237.1 million, or 25.1%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by fewer Connected Fitness product deliveries, resulting from lower demand during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as well as lower freight and warehousing costs. This decrease was partially offset by higher Precor sales and more Tread+ deliveries during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased $1,405.9 million, or 168.7%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period, our investments in expedited shipping to alleviate our backlog of demand, and increased shipping and component part costs that we expect to carry into the next fiscal year.

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased $196.9 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased inventory reserves in the amount of $222.1 million primarily related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use as a result of our restructuring activities, costs of $169.0 million associated with Precor-branded commercial products, and increased Tread costs of $137.7 million, primarily driven by the launch of Tread in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

On August 12, 2022, as part of our previously announced ongoing restructuring initiatives, we announced the decision to rebalance our e-commerce and retail mix to drive efficiencies and therefore reduce our retail showroom presence across North America.

_Membership & Member Support Services_ The Membership team, which includes third-party support providers, is focused on driving engagement to help us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscription retention rates. The team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has lapsed. The Membership team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded “Century Club” shirts after a Member’s 100 class. The team also communicates with Members with no recent activity through email campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their workout routine. In addition, the Membership team collects and responds to feedback about our platform that is on our primary Facebook group of over 469,000 Members as of June 30, 2022.

Restructuring Plan In February 2022, we announced and began implementing a restructuring plan to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). The Restructuring Plan includes: (i) reducing our headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for our previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities, and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations. We expect the Restructuring Plan to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal 2024.

On July 12, 2022, we announced we are exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and our expansion of our current relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp. Additionally, on August 12, 2022, we announced our decision to perform the following additional restructuring activities: (i) eliminate our North American Field Ops warehouses, including the significant reduction of our delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminate a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exit our real-estate footprints in our Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reduce our North America retail showroom presence. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash charges of approximately $95.0 million primarily composed of severance and other exit costs in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to recognize approximately $75.0 million of asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2023 in connection with the Restructuring Plan.

In July 2022, August 2022 and October 2022, the Company took actions to update the Restructuring Plan. On July 12, 2022, the Company announced it is exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding its current relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp. Additionally, on August 12, 2022, the Company announced the decision to perform the following restructuring activities: (i) fully transitioning its North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of its delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminating a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exiting its real-estate footprints in its Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reducing its retail showroom presence. On October 6, 2022, the Company announced approximately 500 global team member positions have been eliminated.

We lease our production studio facilities, which are located in New York City and London, and are used to support our Subscription segment. In addition, we lease and sublease field operations and distribution facilities primarily in North America and Europe, which are used to support our Connected Fitness segment.

In May 2021, we announced plans to build a U.S. manufacturing facility in Troy Township, Ohio, which we called "Peloton Output Park" and is where we had planned to manufacture Connected Fitness Products in addition to our existing manufacturing facilities. In February 2022, as part of the 2022 Restructuring Plan, we announced the closing of several assembly and manufacturing plants, including our plans to sell the facility that was intended to be Peloton Output Park. In January 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). We believe that the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount by approximately 15%, which impacted roughly 400 Peloton team members; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

# <a id="src-7"></a>Source: annual report 10k 2024.pdf (Citation 7)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Upon full implementation, we expect the plan to result in reduced annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal year 2025.

We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair our ability to conduct any of our key business functions. However, we may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the 2022 Restructuring Plan and the 2024 Restructuring Plan, and costs may be greater than _expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business.”_

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

This was especially important in Germany, where we transitioned our operations to an entirely third-party retail and distribution model. This means that while our first-party website will remain live to serve as a brand awareness and product education platform, we are now directing traffic to third-party retailers, namely Amazon and FitShop for sales and fulfillment. Germany sales have outperformed our internal expectations following the third-party transition. We are optimistic that this channel strategy could provide a more capital-efficient model to explore expansion into additional international markets over time.

Paid connected fitness subscribers in our international markets grew 8% in Q1. We remain bullish on international as a source for long-term growth based on the strong retention and engagement trends that mirror those in our North America business. We continue to optimize our sales channel strategy for stronger unit economics in our North American business as well. In Q1, we continued our efforts to close underperforming first-party retail stores.

Next month, we will test the reimagined smaller store concept in Nashville, Tennessee to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model. We also expanded third-party and online retail capabilities ahead of the all-important holiday season. On our website, we launched an exciting partnership with Truemed in early October, which makes it easier for qualified U.S.-based customers to use pre-tax, HSA or FSA dollars to purchase Peloton products. We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, the Peloton Bike Plus will be available at Costco this holiday season with special pricing across 300 U.S.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Total charges related to the Restructuring Plan were $611.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, consisting of cash charges of $109.1 million for severance and other personnel and $15.4 million for professional fees and other related charges, and non-cash charges of $373.8 million related to non-inventory asset write-downs and write-offs, $56.5 million for stock-based compensation expense and $56.4 million for inventory markdowns.

In addition to the above charges, the Company has incurred approximately $86.6 million of capital expenditures related to Peloton Output Park since project inception.

And then third is deepening the connection that we have with our existing members, which, in particular, has the potential to lengthen the lifetimes that we have with our members, which are already impressively long. So again, no specifics today, but that's where to look.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And I'll take the question about the continuing profitability improvement. As you just heard us say a few minutes ago, we did just raise our full-year adjusted EBITDA target for FY '25 by $60 million. And so that is reflecting continued improvements in profitability that we expect largely due to our gross margin expansion that we talked about, as well as continued operating expense savings.

We are on track to exceed our $200 million annualized run rate cost savings plan by the end of fiscal '25 that we committed to in our restructuring plan back in May of 2024. And then on top of that, as we continue to talk about, we are seeing upside from savings in media, which we also expect to be down materially year over year for the remainder of FY '25. And while we're pleased with this progress that we've made, we do see further opportunities for cost optimizations, and we built a culture of cost discipline into our company. We know that our opex as a percent of revenue is still too high overall for the long term and especially that's true within our G&A area.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton: Strategic Pivot and the Path to Growth

Based on the J.P. Morgan analyst reports from August and November 2025, the firm maintains a **Neutral** rating on Peloton. The analysts acknowledge Peloton's status as a market leader with a loyal base but highlight significant challenges regarding the company's ability to return to sustainable top-line growth.

### **Competitive Positioning**

J.P. Morgan positions Peloton as the dominant player in interactive fitness, characterized by a unique vertically integrated business model.

*   **Market Leadership and Scale:** Peloton is identified as the "largest interactive fitness platform in the world" with over 6 million members globally[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2). The analysts note that Peloton's membership represents only ~4% of global gym memberships, suggesting a significant theoretical runway for future growth[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Vertically Integrated Model:** A key competitive advantage identified is Peloton's control over the "entire member journey" through its vertically integrated model (hardware, software, and content). This allows the company to deliver a "members-first mission" and drives a "passionate and highly engaged member base"[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Valuation Discount:** Despite its market leadership, Peloton trades at a discount compared to consumer subscription peers. As of November 2025, the price target of $9.00 is based on ~12x CY27 estimated Free Cash Flow (FCF), representing a discount to peers trading at an average of ~38x due to Peloton's "lower growth & profit profile"[[Source 5]](#src-5).

### **Key Opportunities**

The reports highlight several strategic initiatives implemented by CEO Peter Stern intended to drive profitability and eventually restore growth.

*   **Strategic Pivot to Wellness:** A major opportunity identified is broadening Peloton’s focus beyond cardio fitness to include "wellness." This includes scaling offerings in **Strength** and entering new categories such as **Meditation, Sleep, Recovery, Nutrition, and Hydration**[[Source 6]](#src-6)[[Source 7]](#src-7).
*   **Cost Rationalization and Efficiency:** J.P. Morgan views the company's cost discipline positively. Peloton is on track to realize over **$100 million in annualized savings** by the end of FY2026 through headcount reductions, lower indirect spend, and work relocation[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 9]](#src-9). The analysts are encouraged by the company's progress in improving profit, ramping FCF, and deleveraging the balance sheet[[Source 6]](#src-6)[[Source 10]](#src-10).
*   **Product Innovation:** The analysts point to investments in driving awareness for new products, specifically the **Peloton Cross Training Series** and **Peloton IQ** (AI-driven personalization), as key drivers for future growth[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 11]](#src-11).
*   **Pricing and Monetization:** There is an opportunity to improve unit economics through pricing adjustments. This includes rationalizing promotions, introducing optional expert assembly fees, and potential upside from All-Access subscription price increases[[Source 7]](#src-7)\> <[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13).
*   **Commercial and Retail Expansion:** The creation of a **unified commercial business unit** combining Peloton and Precor is seen as a strategic lever to expand reach[[Source 14]](#src-14). Additionally, the analysts note the plan to expand from one to ten "microstores" to grow physical presence efficiently[[Source 15]](#src-15).

### **Key Threats and Risks**

Despite the operational improvements, J.P. Morgan identifies substantial risks, primarily centered on the uncertainty of demand and intense market competition.

*   **Visibility on Growth:** The most significant threat identified is the difficulty in returning to Connected Fitness (CF) subscriber and revenue growth. The analysts note that "visibility is limited given secular & macro pressures" and that a return to growth remains "challenging"[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Intense Competition:** The reports identify heavy competition as a downside risk, specifically citing **Apple Fitness+, Equinox/SoulCycle, BODY, Tonal, and Tempo** as key rivals[[Source 16]](#src-16)[[Source 17]](#src-17).
*   **Macroeconomic and Tariff Headwinds:** The company faces "secular & macro pressures"[[Source 3]](#src-3). Specific headwinds include tariffs, with Peloton anticipating additional reciprocal tariffs on imported tablets from Thailand and existing tariffs on aluminum content[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 15]](#src-15).
*   **Valuation Support:** There is a risk regarding "less traditional valuation support" compared to subscription peers, as there is no clear comparable company and limited visibility into near-term demand trends[[Source 18]](#src-18)[[Source 19]](#src-19).

Access & other price increases. While churn has been in-line with expectations after

recent price raises, PTON expects 2QFY churn to increase Y/Y & sequentially due to

subscriptuon pauses & cancellations, though FY26 churn will be flat Y/Y — implying

improved 2HFY26 churn dynamics. More broadly, PTON cited US CF industry trends

declining ~LSD%, improvement from recent levels, though lower Y/Y CF hardware

sales are factored into PTON’s FY26 Revenue guide. Following the launch of Peloton

across hardware sales & CF Subscribers, partly offset by sales growth in Precor

products. However, we believe this could prove conservative given product

innovation & likely pricing adjustments, and the FY26 Revenue guide suggests

inflection to Y/Y growth during the fiscal year. PTON plans to rationalize promos

& adjust pricing to reflect its operational costs (incl. shipping/delivery, returns,

tariffs, & other fees) & increase the value of its offering, & PTON will introduce

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton Workforce Restructuring and Headcount Trends 2023–2025

Based on the **ESG Reports (including the 2025 Impact Report)** and **Proxy Statements** from FY2023 to FY2025, here is the breakdown of Peloton's workforce changes and restructuring efforts.

### **Current Employee Count**

As of **June 30, 2025**, Peloton’s global workforce consisted of **2,656 team members**[[Source 1]](#src-1).

*   **Note on Composition:** This figure includes employees of Precor, a wholly-owned subsidiary[[Source 2]](#src-2).

### **Workforce Reductions and Trends (FY2023–FY2025)**

The documentation reveals a consistent downward trend in headcount as the company executed multiple restructuring plans to right-size its operations.

_Impact Report 2025_[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2)

**Key Observation:** The decline in core Peloton staff is significant. While the FY2023 count (3,584) excluded Precor, the FY2025 count (2,656) _includes_ Precor, indicating that the reduction in legacy Peloton staff is steeper than the headline numbers suggest.

### **Specific Restructuring Actions**

The Proxy Statements and ESG reports highlight three major restructuring phases aimed at reducing fixed costs and improving cash flow.

*   **2022 Restructuring Plan:** Initiated to realign operational focus, this plan involved "getting the right people in the right roles" and stabilizing cash flow[[Source 5]](#src-5). The ESG report noted that the company provided support to team members impacted by this restructuring, including cash compensation, extended healthcare, and career support services[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **2024 Restructuring Plan:** Announced in May 2024, this plan aimed to position the company for sustained positive free cash flow. It included a **global headcount reduction of approximately 15%**, which impacted roughly **400 team members**[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, the company announced a new plan involving further "reduction in global headcount" to achieve at least **$100 million in run-rate cost savings** by the end of Fiscal 2026[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).

### **Workforce Strategy & Support**

Despite the reductions, the ESG and Proxy reports emphasize a strategy of "talent density" and support for the remaining workforce:

*   **Compensation:** The company completed pay equity studies in FY2023 and FY2025, finding no statistically significant pay gaps based on gender or race[[Source 11]](#src-11)[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Wages:** Peloton offers a starting hourly rate of no less than $19 for non-sales hourly roles in the US[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Engagement:** In FY2025, the company reported an engagement score of 77% favorable and an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 74%, an increase of 12 points from the prior year[[Source 13]](#src-13).

BUSINESS UPDATE

We entered Fiscal 2023 hard at work on the restructuring plan that we initiated in February 2022 to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, enable us to scale the business, and facilitate improved costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). At that time, we had three primary short-term goals for the business: stabilizing cash flow, getting the right people in the right roles, and returning to growth.

Our Fiscal 2023 results reflect the substantial progress that we have made re-architecting our business in pursuit of these goals. We achieved positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, excluding the costs of a one-time legal settlement, which was an important milestone in rightsizing the cost structure of our business. Our Fiscal 2023 summary results were as follows:

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). We believe that the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount by approximately 15%, which impacted roughly 400 Peloton team members; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

Our commitments Our work

Maintain 100% pay equity across gender and race/ethnicity Each year, we will conduct a global pay equity study across gender and race/ethnicity and address pay gaps.

In FY23, we commissioned a third-party consultant to conduct a global pay equity study Based on the study’s results, we adjusted base pay for a small number of team members to address gaps.2

100% of all interviewers required to undergo Hiring@Peloton training This training includes bias mitigation. Additional talent acquisition efforts include evaluating all job descriptions to reduce the risk of biased language, and leveraging consistent sourcing tools to ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates.

Engaging our people Since we know that people are more likely to perform at their best when they are engaged, we listen carefully to our team members, including through our annual global team member experience survey, The Input. This provides a consistent company-wide forum for team members to contribute their perspectives, in turn giving Peloton’s leadership visibility into team member sentiment.

In FY25, 91% of our team members completed our team member experience survey. The results demonstrated significant progress on several important metrics compared to FY24, including a rise of 12 points in our Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) to 74%.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton's Path to Financial Decline: Five Strategic Failures

Based on the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Risk Factors sections of the Annual Reports (Form 10-K) for Fiscal Years 2022 through 2024, Peloton management identified the following five primary factors as the causes of the company's financial difficulties.

### 1\. Inability to Accurately Forecast Post-Pandemic Demand

Management consistently identified the extreme difficulty in forecasting consumer behavior following the COVID-19 pandemic as a root cause of financial strain. The company scaled its operations assuming pandemic-era growth would persist, leading to significant misalignment when demand normalized.

*   **Management Quote:** "Fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business."[[Source 1]](#src-1)
*   **Management Quote:** "We have had significant difficulty in forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance."[[Source 1]](#src-1),[[Source 2]](#src-2)

### 2\. Excess Inventory and Supply Chain Commitments

Directly resulting from the forecasting challenges mentioned above, Peloton faced severe inventory gluts. The company had committed to long-term supply agreements and built up stock to meet anticipated demand that did not materialize, forcing them to write down inventory value and incur storage costs.

*   **Management Quote:** "Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand has resulted in, and may continue to result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices."[[Source 3]](#src-3)
*   **Management Quote:** "Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue... increased... primarily driven by increased inventory reserves... related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use."[[Source 4]](#src-4)

### 3\. Product Safety Issues and Recalls (Tread+ and Bike Seat Post)

Operational and financial momentum was severely impacted by safety recalls, specifically regarding the Tread+ (May 2021) and the original Bike seat post (May 2023). These recalls resulted in halted sales, expensive retrofits, returns, legal costs, and reputational damage.

*   **Management Quote:** "The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, brand reputation, and business."[[Source 5]](#src-5)
*   **Management Quote:** "We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings... related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that... could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention... and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs."[[Source 6]](#src-6)

### 4\. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Inflation

Management identified external economic pressures as a significant factor reducing consumer discretionary spending. Rising inflation increased the company's component and logistics costs while simultaneously reducing the purchasing power of their target consumers.

*   **Management Quote:** "Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect."[[Source 7]](#src-7)
*   **Management Quote:** "Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses... if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases."[[Source 8]](#src-8)

### 5\. Market Saturation and Intense Competition

As the connected fitness market matured, Peloton faced challenges regarding market saturation and intense competition from both digital apps and traditional gyms reopening. Management noted that the rapid growth phase of the industry had slowed, making customer acquisition more difficult and costly.

*   **Management Quote:** "The connected fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain."[[Source 9]](#src-9)
*   **Management Quote:** "We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps."[[Source 10]](#src-10)

Our financial profile has been characterized by strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, yields an attractive LTV for our Connected Fitness Subscriptions well in excess of our CAC. Maintaining an attractive LTV/CAC ratio is a primary goal of our customer acquisition strategy.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Update and Recent Developments As we have previously disclosed, forecasting for our business during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in its more recent stages, has proven to be very challenging. While we have been able to grow more than we anticipated just two years ago, fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business. Although our belief in the positive long-term outlook for Connected Fitness remains unchanged, the long-term cost demands of our business require us to recalibrate our near-term expectations. Additionally, while demand for our Connected Fitness Products has continued to strongly outpace pre-pandemic levels, we have had significant difficulty in _forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operating results have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.”_

Although in certain instances our agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers or partners. In addition, we may deem it necessary or advisable to renegotiate agreements with our supply partners in order to scale our inventory with demand. Disputes with our supply partners regarding our agreements could result in litigation, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs as well as disruption to our supply chain and require management’s attention. Further, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain _circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings.

### Subscription 67.7 % 62.1 %

_Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021_

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased $196.9 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased inventory reserves in the amount of $222.1 million primarily related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use as a result of our restructuring activities, costs of $169.0 million associated with Precor-branded commercial products, and increased Tread costs of $137.7 million, primarily driven by the launch of Tread in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members

_Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation._

We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties, or may arise from upgrades or changes to hardware that we or our third-party manufacturing partners may make in the ordinary course of a product’s lifecycle. Actual or perceived defects may not be identified until after a product is in market. Any defects could impact our customer experience, tarnish our brand reputation or make our products and services unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and/or personal injury. We may also become subject to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. For example, we have received reports of injuries associated with our Tread+ product, one of which led to the death of a child. As a result of the aforementioned injuries associated with these reported Tread+ incidents, in April 2021, the CPSC unilaterally issued a warning to consumers about the safety hazards associated with the Tread+. While we do not agree with all of the assertions in the CPSC’s warning, in May 2021 we initiated a voluntary recall of our Tread+ product in collaboration with the CPSC. The CPSC is currently investigating the matter and in August 2022 we were notified by the CPSC that the agency staff believes we failed to meet our statutory obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act and intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties. The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, bran...

We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that, regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations, and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, the occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations, recalls, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if Members or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products are injured. Even if injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur _expenses to defend or settle any claims or government inquiries and our brand and reputation may be harmed.

_An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and services._

Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary conditions, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit and spending power, levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions and fluctuations. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. For example, in more recent quarters, we have experienced reduced consumer demand, partially contributing to a decrease in Connected Fitness Products revenue relative to prior year periods. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

_Inflation Risk_ As a result of inflationary conditions, there have been and may continue to be additional pressures on the ongoing increases in supply chain and logistics costs, materials costs, and labor costs. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have recently experienced the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures.

_The connected fitness market is relatively new and, if the general market and specific demand for our products and services does not resume growth, or fails to grow as much as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected._

The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new and grew rapidly over the last several years, and it is uncertain whether it will resume high levels of growth and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt our products and services. We have had to educate consumers about our products and services through significant investment and provide quality content that is superior to the content and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any, and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will develop or be sustained at current levels, that the public’s interest in connected fitness and wellness will continue, or that our products and services will be widely adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.

_We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors._

Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that compete with ours.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton's Strategic Turnaround: From Expansion to Profitable Growth

Based on the FY2024 and FY2025 10-K filings and earnings call transcripts, Peloton’s turnaround strategy has shifted from rapid expansion to a focus on **sustainable, profitable growth** and **free cash flow**. Management executed this through three distinct restructuring plans (2022, 2024, and 2025) and specific operational initiatives designed to repair unit economics.

The following sections outline the key elements of these strategies.

### 1\. The Restructuring Plans (2022–2025)

Management implemented three major phases of restructuring to align the company's cost structure with its current revenue base.

Plan

Announcement & Focus

Key Actions & Details

Financial Goal/Impact

**2022 Restructuring Plan**

**Feb 2022**<br>Focus: Exit owned manufacturing and logistics.

*   • **Manufacturing:** Exited all owned-manufacturing operations; expanded relationship with third-party manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp[[Source 1]](#src-1).<br>• **Real Estate:** Closed assembly plants and sold the "Peloton Output Park" facility (shell)[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).<br>• **Logistics:** Transitioned North American Field Operations to third-party logistics (3PL) providers[[Source 1]](#src-1).<br>• **Headcount:** Significant reduction in delivery workforce and member support roles[[Source 1]](#src-1).

Substantially completed by FY2025[[Source 3]](#src-3).

**2024 Restructuring Plan**

**April/May 2024**<br>Focus: Headcount and Retail Footprint.

*   • **Headcount:** Reduced global headcount by approximately 15% (impacting ~400 employees)[[Source 4]](#src-4)[[Source 5]](#src-5).<br>• **Retail:** Accelerated closures of retail showroom locations to reduce fixed costs[[Source 4]](#src-4)[[Source 6]](#src-6).

Targeted **$200 million** in annualized run-rate savings by the end of FY2025[[Source 7]](#src-7). Management reported exceeding this target[[Source 8]](#src-8).

**2025 Restructuring Plan**

**August 2025**<br>Focus: Operating Efficiency & Growth Reinvestment.

*   • **Headcount:** Further reduction in global headcount[[Source 9]](#src-9).<br>• **Cost Structure:** Continued improvement of operating efficiency to reinvest savings into differentiating capabilities[[Source 9]](#src-9).

Targeted at least **$100 million** in run-rate savings by the end of FY2026[[Source 10]](#src-10).

### 2\. Operational Turnaround Strategy

Beyond structural cost cutting, management implemented specific strategic initiatives to improve **unit economics** and **Gross Margin**.

Management moved away from "growth at all costs" to prioritizing the Lifetime Value (LTV) to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio.

*   **Pricing & Promotions:** The company reduced promotional activity, aligning discounts strictly with product margin profiles[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 11]](#src-11). In Q1 FY2025, Peloton raised prices on bike products in international markets to expand gross margins[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Secondary Market Monetization:** A "Used Equipment Activation Fee" was launched to monetize second-hand hardware owners, increasing the LTV of customers joining via the secondary market[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13).
*   **Gross Margin Recovery:** By Q2 FY2025, Connected Fitness Product gross margin returned to double digits (12.9%) for the first time in over three years due to a favorable mix of premium products and pricing discipline[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 14]](#src-14).

Peloton shifted its distribution strategy to lower fixed costs and meet customers where they shop.

*   **Retail Evolution:** The company continued closing underperforming first-party retail stores while testing cost-efficient "micro-store" concepts (e.g., Nashville)[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
*   **Third-Party Retail:** Aggressive expansion into third-party channels, including a seasonal partnership with **Costco** (selling Bike+) and distribution via **Amazon** and **FitShop** in Germany[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
*   **Commercial Business:** Peloton created a unified commercial business unit combining Peloton and **Precor** to target hospitality and gym markets, including a partnership with **Hyatt Hotels**[[Source 17]](#src-17)[[Source 18]](#src-18).

To drive retention and engagement (LTV), management invested in software and hardware innovations.

*   **Hardware Refresh:** Launched the **Cross Training Series** and **Peloton Pro Series** (commercial grade) in October 2025[[Source 19]](#src-19).
*   **New Software/Apps:**

In fiscal year 2023, we continued to take actions to implement the 2022 Restructuring Plan. In July 2022, we announced we were exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding our relationship with a Taiwanese manufacturer, Rexon Industrial Corporation. Additionally, in August 2022, we announced our decision to (i) fully transition our North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of our delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminate a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exit our real-estate footprints in our Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reduce our retail showroom presence. In January 2024, we completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million.

_Restructuring_ In February 2022, we announced and began implementing the 2022 Restructuring Plan to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs. The 2022 Restructuring Plan originally included: (i) reducing our headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for our previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities; and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). The 2024 Restructuring Plan will position us for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling us to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

Upon full implementation, we expect the plan to result in reduced annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of its fiscal year 2025.

However, we may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the 2022 Restructuring Plan and the 2024 Restructuring Plan, and costs may be greater than _expected.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Progress on cost reduction efforts are reflected in our profitability metrics. We are proud to report Q1 results, which include $13 million of GAAP operating income, $11 million of free cash flow, and $116 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our results also highlight the continued strength of our category-leading connected fitness subscription business, which has over 6 million loyal members, 2.9 million connected fitness subscribers, 586,000 app subscribers and over $1.7 billion of annualized subscription revenue was 68% gross margin. I am thrilled to see our cost reduction efforts materialize in our financial performance to date.

And I must say the team has done an incredible job not only to deliver but to exceed our goals thus far in reducing costs. A key part of managing our business toward profitable growth involves ensuring all the subscribers we acquire are profitable and ensuring we have sustainable unit economics. We manage our business through a lens of LTV to CAC and have taken actions to improve the areas that are in our immediate control on both the LTV and the CAC side of the equation. To enhance customer LTV, we are focused on expanding connected fitness products' gross margin across all of our products, sales channels, and markets, leading us to make certain pricing changes and reduce promotional activity in Q1.

We also launched the used equipment activation fee, which increases the LTV for new customers who joined Peloton via the secondary market. Chris will talk in more detail about what we're doing to reduce our customer acquisition costs as well. Some of the pricing changes I mentioned were specific to our international business, where we raised the price for all of our bike products in all international markets in the first quarter to expand connected fitness product gross margin.

Furthermore, we have offered and may in the future offer, new subscription products, implement promotions, or replace or modify current subscription models and pricing, any of which could result in additional costs or could adversely impact Subscriber retention. For example, we offer Peloton Rental in select markets, and we have launched a Used Equipment Activation Fee applicable to Connected Fitness Products purchased in the secondary market. In the future, we may introduce shipping and return fees, or tariff surcharges. It is unknown how our Subscribers will react to new models and whether the costs or logistics of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the adoption of new revenue models adversely impacts our Subscriber relationships, Subscriber growth, Subscriber engagement, and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.

This was especially important in Germany, where we transitioned our operations to an entirely third-party retail and distribution model. This means that while our first-party website will remain live to serve as a brand awareness and product education platform, we are now directing traffic to third-party retailers, namely Amazon and FitShop for sales and fulfillment. Germany sales have outperformed our internal expectations following the third-party transition. We are optimistic that this channel strategy could provide a more capital-efficient model to explore expansion into additional international markets over time.

Paid connected fitness subscribers in our international markets grew 8% in Q1. We remain bullish on international as a source for long-term growth based on the strong retention and engagement trends that mirror those in our North America business. We continue to optimize our sales channel strategy for stronger unit economics in our North American business as well. In Q1, we continued our efforts to close underperforming first-party retail stores.

Next month, we will test the reimagined smaller store concept in Nashville, Tennessee to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model. We also expanded third-party and online retail capabilities ahead of the all-important holiday season. On our website, we launched an exciting partnership with Truemed in early October, which makes it easier for qualified U.S.-based customers to use pre-tax, HSA or FSA dollars to purchase Peloton products. We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, the Peloton Bike Plus will be available at Costco this holiday season with special pricing across 300 U.S.

Connected Fitness Sales Channels We continue to optimize our sales and distribution channels. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued our retail store closure efforts, and next month we plan to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model by testing a reimagined smaller store concept. Ahead of the holiday season, we are expanding our third party retail channels as well. The Peloton Bike+ will be available at Costco with special pricing for Costco members across 300 US locations and Costco's website for a limited time. We also shifted our German retail and distribution model to Amazon and FitShop, allowing us to operate in a capital efficient way that we believe may serve as a model for future International expansion.

Peter Stern CEO, President & Director

Bill, I love your leaderboard name. Strategically, our commercial business unit is set up to win. First, the market opportunity is large, and we still have very low share. And when I talk to gym operators, they all tell me that there's only one brand that consumers ask for by name, and that's Peloton. Second, the combination of Precor and Peloton just makes sense. You think about Precor's brawn coming together with Peloton's brains, and you've got something no one else can match. And let me explain what I mean by that because we've got plenty of smart people over on the Precor team. Precor builds equipment that is truly commercial grade. It's the kind of stuff that's built to be run like 12 hours a day. And they also have the installation and service capabilities for commercial establishments. Peloton has software, content, community that's absolutely unmatched. You bring those things together, and we've got every reason to be able to win.

Access to the Strength+ App is available with an All Access, Guide, or App+ Membership or through a standalone Strength+ subscription.

We are additionally focused on growing our Paid App subscribers, including through efforts such as our branding and App relaunch in May 2023 and launch of the Strength+ App in December 2024. We define a “Connected Fitness Subscription” as a person, household, or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building, who has paid for a subscription to a Connected Fitness Product (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers).

Meeting Members in More Places Meeting Members in more places is another way to improve our service and grow our business.

The mix of Member engagement in these categories is increasing, so we’re responding by creating even more experiences to serve these needs. Additionally, with so many classes to choose from, we want to help our Members reach their goals more easily by recommending the best workouts for them. In January, we launched Personalized Plans, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable Members to create workout plans tailored to their goals and preferences. Nearly half a million Members started a Personalized Plan in the three months ended March 31, 2025, and we’re pleased with the repeat engagement from Members using them.

greater capital efficiency and improved unit economics.

Deepening Connections Among Our Members As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance, thereby going further, faster. And research shows that people achieve better fitness outcomes when they work out together. So we’re focused on deepening connections among our more than 6.0 million Members, both with Peloton and with our supportive community. In September, we launched Teams, which enables Members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch, and Members who join them are more likely to work out. In the three months ended December 31, 2024, we hosted the 11th annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burn where over 50,000 Members worked out together live. This year’s Turkey Burn also brought "The Feast," our first Thanksgiving live Strength class and the largest live Strength class in Peloton’s history.

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

# <a id="src-main"></a> The Peter Stern Era: Peloton’s Strategic Evolution 2025

Based on the earnings transcripts, 8-K filings, and proxy statements from January 2025 through November 2025, Peter Stern’s strategic vision centers on evolving Peloton from a connected fitness company into a broader "fitness and wellness" ecosystem. His stated purpose for the company is to "**empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy**"[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).

To achieve this, Stern defined a "magic formula" comprising premium equipment, AI-powered software, world-class instructors, and a supportive community[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4). Since taking over as CEO on January 1, 2025, he has implemented changes across four primary strategic pillars:

### 1\. Improve Member Outcomes through Innovation

Stern’s strategy prioritizes holistic health outcomes over simple hardware sales, expanding into strength, mental wellness, and recovery.

*   **AI and Personalization (Peloton IQ):** Stern launched **Peloton IQ** in October 2025, an AI-powered personalized coach that uses data from wearables and class history to provide individual guidance and recommendations[[Source 5]](#src-5)[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **Hardware Overhaul (Cross Training Series):** In October 2025, Peloton released the **Cross Training Series** (Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row+). These devices feature swivel screens for floor workouts and, in the "Plus" line, advanced computer vision to count reps and correct form[[Source 3]](#src-3)\> <[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **Expansion into Wellness:**
    *   **Mental Fitness:** In September 2025, Peloton acquired **Breathwrk**, a subscription app for breathing exercises, integrating it into Peloton memberships[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).
    *   **Medical Partnerships:** Stern announced collaborations with the **Hospital for Special Surgery** for injury prevention content and **Respin Health** to study and support menopause[[Source 11]](#src-11).
*   **Software Apps:** Stern oversaw the scaling of the **Strength+ App** (launched December 2024), designed for gym-based strength training[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13). Conversely, the company **discontinued the sale of the Peloton Guide** hardware in July 2025, shifting focus to software-based tracking[[Source 8]](#src-8).

### 2\. Meet Members Everywhere (Expansion of Distribution)

Stern shifted the company’s distribution strategy to meet customers in physical retail spaces and commercial settings.

*   **Commercial Push (Pro Series):** He established a unified commercial business unit combining Peloton and Precor. This included launching the **Peloton Pro Series** (commercial-grade Bike+, Tread+, and Row+) for hotels and multi-family residences[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 14]](#src-14).
*   **Retail Partnerships & Footprint:**
    *   **Micro-Stores:** Expanded from one to ten "micro-stores" in the U.S. by late 2025 to provide capital-efficient physical touchpoints[[Source 15]](#src-15).
    *   **Third-Party Retail:** Entered a partnership with **Johnson Fitness & Wellness** to place products in 100 retail locations and utilized **Costco** as a seasonal partner[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).

### 3\. Make Members for Life (Deepening Connection)

To increase retention and lifetime value (LTV), Stern introduced gamification and loyalty mechanics.

*   **Club Peloton:** Launched a loyalty and recognition program in late 2025, where members unlock exclusive content and rewards based on engagement[[Source 18]](#src-18).
*   **Teams:** Introduced official instructor-led "Teams" (e.g., "Move for Life," "HYROX") to foster social connections and competition among members[[Source 16]](#src-16)[[Source 18]](#src-18).

### 4\. Operational Discipline and Financial Efficiency

Stern continued the restructuring efforts begun by his predecessors to ensure sustainable cash flow.

*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, Stern announced a new restructuring plan involving global headcount reductions to target at least **$100 million in run-rate savings** by the end of FY2026[[Source 19]](#src-19)[[Source 20]](#src-20).
*   **Pricing Adjustments:** He implemented monetization initiatives, including expert assembly fees and subscription price changes in late 2025, accepting a temporary increase in churn to improve long-term unit economics[[Source 21]](#src-21)[[Source 22]](#src-22).
*   **Executive Compensation Redesign:** For FY2026, the compensation structure for leadership was redesigned to heavily weight performance-based stock units (PSUs) and reduce cash salaries, aligning executive pay more aggressively with shareholder value and free cash flow targets[[Source 23]](#src-23)[[Source 24]](#src-24).

The Peloton team has made impressive progress over the last few quarters in putting the company on sound financial footing. Nonetheless, we have a tall hill to climb before we can demonstrate the impact of that virtuous cycle on member and revenue growth. So right now, our primary focus is on executing against and delivering our fiscal '25 financial and operating goals while we prepare to climb that tall hill in fiscal '26 and beyond. We'll share more about longer-term strategy as the calendar year progresses.

But today, I can share my perspective after one month of official duties at Peloton. Achieving the new purpose we've defined for ourselves empowering people to live fit, strong, long, and happy means we need to focus on innovation on new products and experiences that lead to even better outcomes for members, presence in more places, so we can meet members wherever they are. More ways to connect members with Peloton and our uniquely supportive community. And last but certainly not least, improved unit economics and the cost structure that's rightsized for our business.

Overview

Peloton is a leading global fitness and wellness company that empowers its Members to live fit, strong, long, and happy by providing fitness and wellness products and services they can use anytime, anywhere. We have a highly engaged community of nearly 6 million Members as of September 30, 2025, across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Austria. As a category innovator at the nexus of fitness and wellness, technology, and media, we deliver experiences through our world-renowned Instructors, premium hardware and innovative software, personalization, and extensive modalities and content formats. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, Peloton aims to scale across the markets in which it operates.

Throughout the quarter, the Peloton team was hard at work, setting the stage for our new chapter by innovating on every aspect of our magic formula of premium equipment, software powered by AI, world-class instructors and a deeply engaged community. In last quarter's remarks, I laid out Peloton's strategy. The first and most foundational part of that strategy is our commitment to improving member outcomes. To that end, on October 1, we simultaneously unveiled and began shipping the most significant product update in our history with an all-new equipment lineup, the Peloton Cross Training Series and the Peloton Pro series.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

Before we open for Q&A, I'd like to hand it back to Peter to talk about what makes Peloton so special and gives us such optimism for the future.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Liz. You and the team should be proud of the work you all accomplished in Q2. There are lots of companies that make fitness equipment, dozens of fitness apps, countless trainers, but there is only one Peloton. That's because we combine the best hardware, the best software, and the best human coaches with the world's most supportive community.

We've made several additional upgrades, including improvements in audio across the board and featuring sound by Sonos in our Plus line for a studio-like experience. On October 1, we also launched Peloton IQ, which gives every Peloton member a personalized coach regardless of whether they own our new Cross Training Series, our Original Series or work out with a Peloton app subscription. Peloton IQ uses AI to turn years of insights and data points, including your goals, class activity and health stats from wearable devices into personal training guidance. In so doing, Peloton IQ makes some of the benefits of personal training accessible to millions of people, providing individual insights and recommendations based on members' intentions, preferences, level of fitness and performance.

So let me start with the usage point. It's actually been really -- that's been really positive. So we mentioned earlier that we've had 500,000 of our members use Club Peloton already. We're also seeing more people taking workouts from our home screen, and let me explain why that matters. For a lot of our members, they kind of stay with the same old, same old. They go to the classes page, and go to their comfort zone. But when people are taking workouts from the home screen, it means that the recommendations that we're delivering with Peloton IQ are starting to hit home.

Our understanding of human health has progressed since Peloton took the world by storm with the introduction of the original bike. And today, we know that adults need to pursue a combination of cardio, strength and more to achieve their wellness goals. To that end, all Peloton products now feature advanced swivel screens, allowing members to easily transition between cardio and strength to complete floor workouts, including strength, yoga, Pilates and stretching. Our new Plus line includes an advanced computer vision movement tracking camera that counts your reps, corrects your form and offers weight suggestions in real time, along with voice control, enabling members to adjust weights, skip moves or pause their workout without touching a thing.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s Connected Fitness Products portfolio included the Original Series Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row, Guide (discontinued as of July 2025), and various Precor products. In October 2025, the Company launched a refreshed portfolio of Connected Fitness Products called the Cross Training Series, including the Cross Training Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row+. The Company continues to sell the refurbished Original Series Peloton Bike and Bike+. Additionally, the Company launched the Peloton Pro Series, a refresh of its portfolio of commercial-certified Peloton-branded products, which now include the Bike+ Pro, Tread+ Pro, and Row+ Pro.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

We define a “Member” as any individual who has a Peloton account through a Paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a Paid App Subscription, inclusive of the Peloton App+, App One, Strength+, and Breathwrk Memberships (our “Peloton Apps”), and engages in one or more workouts in the trailing 12-month period. We define workout engagement as either (i) completing the lesser of 50% or 10 minutes of Instructor-led classes, Scenic, and Lanebreak workouts; (ii) at least 10 minutes of any activity tracking workout (such as “Just Ride”, “Just Run”, or “Just Row”) or Entertainment workout; (iii) at least 5 minutes of any Strength+ workout with 80% of sets marked complete; or (iv) completing a Breathwrk class.

We also announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the Hospital for Special Surgery, the world leader in orthopedics to offer Peloton members access to expert care for joint and muscle pain, injuries and orthopedic conditions. We've co-developed class collections with HSS medical experts, recently launching the first 5 on preventing some of the most common types of injuries. We're also committed to meeting members where they are in their life stages. In response to member demand, we started with menopause, a life stage that impacts the majority of our members at some point in their lives. We're extremely proud of our partnership with Respin Health, founded by Halle Berry to revolutionize menopause care with an integrated holistic approach, and have just launched a study with over 1,000 women to measure the benefits of targeted movement strategies and other evidence-based lifestyle interventions. These findings will power our evolving evidence-based exercise programming and menopause support.

On the cardio side, we continue to elevate Tread, thanks to our marketing efforts, which enabled us to exceed our Tread portfolio sales goals and achieve higher new subscription attach rates on Tread and Tread+ sales year over year in Q2. And with the release of our 10K training program in Q2, Peloton now offers training for all major race distances. And already over 300,000 members have trained for a running race with Peloton. We're also seeing the positive impact of innovative new software features like Pace Targets, which offer running instruction with personalized intensity levels rather than treadmill speed.

Nearly 60% of our members who take instructor-led running workouts on our Tread products are using Pace Targets, and our members running paces are improving as a result. Another way to improve our business is to meet members in more places. For example, at the gym. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app offering non-class strength training programs with audio guidance from expert coaches and a custom workout generator.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

Our commercial business unit continues to show strong performance and is an area in which we are also innovating. The new Peloton Pro series offers a complete lineup of Peloton equipment for commercial environments such as hotel gyms and multi-residential buildings, and includes the Tread+ Pro, Peloton's first ever commercial treadmill. And Precor launched its new commercial Tread, the Breakaway. This new slat belt treadmill includes a sled-style push mode, cadence coach and a new console design. Peloton also recently became the primary fitness partner powering Utah City, a 700-acre mixed-use development outside of Salt Lake City. And now every residential building in Utah City will feature a Peloton space that includes several pieces of Peloton equipment and accessories for residents.

The second part of our strategy is to meet members everywhere. We have made great progress on this front over the past few weeks. We now have 10 micro stores in the U.S., up from 1 prior to Q1. And we also announced a new retail partnership with Johnson Fitness & Wellness, the nation's largest independent fitness retailer with 100 locations across the U.S. We now have a physical retail presence in 46 states, while in Australia, we launched a retail presence in 11 franchise locations throughout the country. Our expanded retail footprint positions us well for the holiday season, providing opportunities for consumers to test and experience our new innovations.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

drove more Bike+ unit sales than any other third-party retail partner, enabling us to meet many new members at a retailer they trust. And we remain focused on meeting more new members across the globe. We are encouraged by the performance of international hardware sales in Q2 alongside our continued growth in Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions from international markets. Turning to the connections between Peloton's members with the company and with each other.

As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance. So we are focused on deepening the connections our 6 million members have with each other and with Peloton. In September, we launched Teams, which enables members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch.

# <a id="src-17"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 17)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Bill, you talked also about a third point I'd raise, which is international. Peloton is only in 6 countries right now, but Precor is in over 60 countries. So that opens up opportunities for Peloton to enter these new markets in ways that build on existing distribution and relationships that we've already got, starting with B2B. So strategically, we're in a great place. It's just an execution challenge from here, and you can already see us executing on this. For example, Precor now provides all the installation and service for Peloton commercial locations, including hotels. Last month, we announced Precor's first slated tread, the Breakaway with a new smarter, more powerful screen and Peloton's first-ever commercial tread initially for hospitality and for multi-dwelling units was launched as part of the new Peloton Pro line. So you add all of this up, I feel great about where we are with our commercial business unit, and I'm confident we're going to be able to bring this together and deliver an industry-leading set of products and solutions on behalf of commercial clients.

The third part of our strategy is to make members for life. Celebrating achievement is crucial for sticking with any program. So last month, we launched Club Peloton, our first loyalty and recognition program. As members engage with our platform, they progress through levels from bronze to legend, unlocking exclusive content recognition and rewards. Already more than 500,000 members have engaged with Club Peloton. On October 1, we also introduced official Peloton teams led by Peloton instructors, including Move for Life, Menopause, HYROX and Cross Training. These teams provide a forum for members to connect, discuss goals and learn from each other and from experts, further elevating Peloton's community. Since October 1, engagement with teams is up nearly 50%.

4\. Restructuring

In February 2022, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring plan (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in April 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded and collectively with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”).

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to continue to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. Our actions under our previous restructuring plans announced in February 2022 (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in May 2024 (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan. The 2022, 2024, and 2025 plans, taken together, are referred to as the “Restructuring Plans.” The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

Ultimately, all these strategic initiatives, product innovation, wellness expansion and new distribution are underpinned by the fourth part of our strategy, our commitment to operational discipline and business excellence. Our full year guidance announced in August included targeted initiatives to improve monetization, such as the introduction of expert assembly fees. These were implemented within the quarter and exceeded our expectations. At the same time, our cost reduction plans remain on track. Perhaps most important, we remain confident in our ability to inflect toward revenue growth as the fiscal year progresses, building on the actions we took in Q1 and on October 1. We continue to monitor and respond to evolving tariff policies and broader changes in the macro environment and consumer spending. While those external factors are real, our focus remains on execution and being the best fitness and wellness partner to our members.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

### REDESIGN OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR FISCAL 2026

OVERVIEW In September 2025, the Compensation Committee approved a comprehensive redesign of our executive compensation program for Fiscal 2026. The Compensation Committee believes the redesign will strengthen our commitment to our pay for performance philosophy and will further align certain key components of the program with prevailing market practice among our compensation peer group. The redesign is applicable to our named executive officers and our leadership team members more broadly, other than Mr. Stern and certain leadership team members who joined the Company in Fiscal 2025, who already have compensation arrangements in place that are designed in accordance with the new compensation philosophy.

# SLIDE 1: From Crisis to Cash Flow — The Turnaround Story

## **Key Message**
Peloton has successfully completed a strategic pivot from a hardware-centric, vertically integrated business model to an asset-light, subscription-focused operation — transforming from burning $2.4B in cash (FY22) to generating $324M in free cash flow (FY25). The structural flaw has been addressed; the question is now whether this smaller, leaner company can return to growth.

---

### Supporting Points

**1. The Scale of the Collapse**
| Metric | FY21 Peak | FY25 | Change |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $4.02B | $2.49B | **-38%** |
| Hardware Revenue | $3.15B | $817M | **-74%** |
| Subscription Revenue | $872M | $1.67B | **+92%** |
| Adjusted EBITDA | +$254M | +$404M | +59%* |
| Free Cash Flow | -$492M | +$324M | **+$816M swing** |

*Note: FY22 EBITDA was -$983M, making the true recovery a $1.4B improvement

**2. The Root Cause Was Structural, Not Just Cyclical**
Management identified five causal factors, but the underlying structural flaw was Peloton's vertically integrated operating model (owned manufacturing, owned logistics, owned retail) which created massive fixed costs that couldn't flex when post-pandemic demand collapsed.

| What Broke | Impact | Restructuring Response |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Owned manufacturing | Overcapacity, inventory write-downs | Exited ALL owned manufacturing; partnered with Rexon |
| Owned logistics | High fixed costs, regional complexity | Shifted to 3PL nationwide |
| 135 retail showrooms | Unsustainable lease obligations | Closed most; pivoted to 10 micro-stores + third-party retail |
| Overstaffed organization | $983M negative EBITDA (FY22) | Reduced headcount from peak to 2,656 (-26% since FY23) |

**3. Revenue Mix Transformation**
The business model has fundamentally shifted:
- FY21: Hardware = 78% of revenue, Subscriptions = 22%
- FY25: Hardware = 33% of revenue, Subscriptions = **67%**

This is not shrinkage—it's transformation. Subscription gross margins (~69%) are 5x hardware margins (~13.6%), meaning profitability improved even as revenue declined.

**4. Cash Position Stabilized**
- FY22: Consumed $2.36B in cash (negative FCF + restructuring charges)
- FY25: Generated $324M in free cash flow
- $722M unrestricted cash on hand
- On track to pay down ~$200M convertible notes (Feb 2026)

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Two-panel chart:**
- **Left panel**: Stacked bar chart showing revenue composition shift (FY21 → FY25) with hardware declining and subscriptions growing as proportion
- **Right panel**: Waterfall chart showing the free cash flow bridge from -$2.36B (FY22) to +$324M (FY25), with restructuring savings and margin improvement as the key drivers

---

### Actionable Insight

> **The restructuring addressed the root cause (fixed-cost vertical integration) rather than just treating symptoms.** However, this was a *survival* strategy, not a *growth* strategy. The company is now right-sized for a ~2.8M subscriber base generating ~$2.5B in revenue. 
>
> **Board Action Required**: Define the strategic intent — is Peloton a "harvest" business (maximize cash flow from existing base) or a "growth" business (reinvest to expand)? Current trajectory supports the former; Peter Stern's initiatives signal ambition for the latter. These require different capital allocation frameworks and management incentives.

---

### Speaker Notes

Peloton's crisis was fundamentally different from a typical demand shock. When pandemic tailwinds reversed in late 2021, the company discovered that its vertically integrated model — which had been a competitive advantage during hyper-growth — had become an existential threat. Unlike competitors who outsourced manufacturing and logistics, Peloton owned factories, warehouses, delivery fleets, and 135 retail showrooms. When revenue fell 38% from peak, these fixed costs couldn't flex, resulting in nearly $3 billion in losses over FY22-FY23.

The restructuring response was appropriately aggressive. By exiting all owned manufacturing (partnering with Rexon), shifting to third-party logistics, and closing most retail showrooms, management converted the cost structure from predominantly fixed to predominantly variable. This structural change is permanent and positions the company to remain profitable even if the subscriber base continues to erode modestly.

However, the board should recognize that this turnaround was achieved through contraction, not innovation. The company is significantly smaller than at its peak, and the current profitability depends on maintaining the existing subscriber base rather than growing it. The question facing the board is whether this is the steady state, or whether the new management team can reignite growth from this stabilized foundation.

# SLIDE 2: Execution Scorecard — Management Credibility Assessment

## **Key Message**
Management has established a consistent track record of beating guidance and raising targets over the past five quarters, earning credibility on operational execution. Cost discipline is a GREEN light; subscriber growth is RED. The board should trust near-term profitability guidance but apply skepticism to any growth projections until proven.

---

### Targets vs. Actuals: The Pattern of Beats

**FY25 Guidance Evolution (Quarterly)**
| Quarter | Initial Target | Final Result | Performance |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| FY25 EBITDA | $200-250M (Aug 2024) | **$404M** | Beat high end by **$154M** |

| FY25 Gross Margin | 47% (Aug 2024) | **50.9%** | Beat by **390 bps** |
| FY25 Revenue | $2.43-2.48B | **$2.49B** | Within range |
| FY25 Subscribers | 2.68-2.75M → 2.75-2.79M | **2.80M** | Beat revised target |

**Q1 FY26 Performance vs. Guidance (Nov 2025)**
| Metric | Guidance | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $540-545M | **$551M** | Beat by $6M |

### RAG Status Assessment

| Strategic Initiative | Status | Evidence |
|---------------------|--------|----------|
| **Cost Reduction** | 🟢 GREEN | 2024 plan: targeted $200M savings, exceeded and accelerated. 2025 plan: $100M target, on track |
| **Free Cash Flow** | 🟢 GREEN | Achieved positive FCF 4 consecutive quarters; raised FY26 target to $250M+ |
| **Gross Margin Expansion** | 🟢 GREEN | Total GM: 36.1% (FY21) → 50.9% (FY25). Hardware GM recovered from -17.6% (FY23) to +13.6% (FY25) |
| **Subscriber Retention** | 🟡 AMBER | Churn increased (0.61% → 1.6%) but stabilizing; Oct 2025 pricing changes creating temporary spike |
| **New Customer Acquisition** | 🔴 RED | Gross additions declining; hardware sales down 18% YoY (FY25); expected to decline further FY26 |
| **Revenue Growth** | 🔴 RED | Revenue declining (-8% FY25, -2% projected FY26); management claims "inflection toward growth" but no concrete timeline |

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators (What to Watch Next)**
| Indicator | Current Signal | Implication |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Member engagement | Up **50%** since Oct 1 | Retention should improve |
| Club Peloton participation | **500K+ members** engaged | Loyalty program gaining traction |
| Member support satisfaction | 3.1 → **4.3** (Q2 FY24 → Q2 FY25) | Service quality improving |
| Hardware gross margin | Back to **double digits** (12.9%) | Unit economics healthy |

**Lagging Indicators (Current Pain Points)**
| Indicator | Current Signal | Implication |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Subscriber count | **2.73M** and declining | Base erosion continues |
| Gross additions | Declining YoY | Acquisition engine not working |
| Hardware revenue | **-18% YoY** (FY25) | New customer entry point shrinking |

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Dashboard-style scorecard with three components:**
1. **Top**: Line chart showing guidance vs. actual for EBITDA/FCF over 5 quarters (pattern of consistent beats)
2. **Middle**: RAG status tiles for each strategic initiative
3. **Bottom**: Two-column comparison of leading indicators (trending positive) vs. lagging indicators (trending negative)

---

### Actionable Insight

> **Management has earned credibility on operational execution but has not yet demonstrated ability to drive growth.** The consistent pattern of "beat and raise" on profitability metrics suggests conservative guidance methodology — the board can trust near-term financial targets.
>
> **However, the RED status on acquisition and growth should trigger heightened scrutiny.** When Peter Stern presents in Q2 FY26 (Feb 2026), demand specific KPIs:
> - What is the target LTV/CAC ratio? (Currently undisclosed; long-term target is 2-3x)
> - What gross additions level is required to stabilize subscriber base?
> - What is the expected payback period on new hardware customers?
>
> **Board Monitoring Recommendation**: Establish a "subscriber floor threshold" — the minimum subscriber count that maintains business viability. Current trajectory suggests ~2.6M by end FY26. If subscriber count approaches 2.5M, trigger a strategic review.

---

### Speaker Notes

The execution scorecard tells a clear story: management can cut costs and improve margins, but hasn't yet proven they can grow the business. Over five consecutive quarters, the team has beaten guidance on profitability metrics, often by substantial margins. The Q1 FY26 result was particularly notable — free cash flow came in at $67 million versus an expectation of slightly negative, a swing of roughly $75-80 million. This wasn't luck; it reflects structural improvements in the cost base and working capital management.

However, the subscriber trajectory should concern the board. The base has declined from a peak of ~3.0 million in FY23 to 2.73 million today, and management is guiding to 2.64-2.67 million by end of Q2 FY26. The pricing changes announced in October 2025 are causing a temporary spike in churn, which management expects to normalize — but the underlying trend of declining gross additions remains unaddressed.

The leading indicators from Peter Stern's initiatives — engagement up 50%, Club Peloton adoption, improved satisfaction scores — are genuinely encouraging. But these are quality metrics, not quantity metrics. The key question for the February earnings call is whether these improvements can translate into acquisition growth, or whether Peloton is simply getting better at retaining a shrinking base.

# SLIDE 3: Strategic Outlook — What Should the Board Do Next?

## **Key Message**
Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent bet on extending member lifetime value and diversifying revenue streams beyond hardware sales. Early execution signals are positive, but the strategy carries material risks. The board should monitor three specific metrics as "trip wires" that would trigger strategy reassessment.

---

### Peter Stern's Strategic Framework (Since Jan 2025)

**Company Purpose**: "Empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy"

**The "Magic Formula"**: Premium equipment + AI software + world-class instructors + supportive community

| Strategic Pillar | Key Initiatives | Status | Early Indicators |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| **1. Improve Member Outcomes** | Peloton IQ (AI coach), Cross Training Series, Breathwrk acquisition, medical partnerships | Launched Oct 2025 | Engagement up 50% |
| **2. Meet Members Everywhere** | Peloton Pro Series (commercial), micro-stores (1→10), Johnson Fitness (100 locations), Precor integration | In progress | Precor in 60+ countries vs. Peloton in 6 |
| **3. Make Members for Life** | Club Peloton (loyalty), Teams (instructor-led communities) | Launched Oct 2025 | 500K+ engaged in Club Peloton |
| **4. Operational Discipline** | 2025 restructuring ($100M savings), exec comp redesign (70% RSUs/30% PSUs) | On track | FY26 FCF target raised to $250M+ |

---

### Key Opportunities (Probability-Weighted Assessment)

| Opportunity | Probability | Impact | Time Horizon | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Content licensing expansion** | Medium-High | High | FY26-27 | Lululemon deal, Hyatt partnership established; model proven |
| **B2B/Commercial via Precor** | Medium | High | FY26-28 | Unified commercial unit created; Precor provides global infrastructure |
| **International expansion** | Low-Medium | High | FY27+ | Currently 6 markets; Precor in 60+ but integration complex |
| **LTV extension through engagement** | Medium-High | Medium | FY26-27 | Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Teams showing early traction |
| **Hardware margin improvement to 20%** | Medium | Medium | FY27+ | Long-term target; currently at 13.6%, improving |

---

### Key Risks (With Mitigation Assessment)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Quality |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Subscriber base erosion** | High | Critical | 🟡 Weak — initiatives focused on retention, not acquisition |
| **Tariff exposure** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — diversified supply chain; $45M impact absorbed in FY26 guidance |
| **Pricing elasticity** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 Moderate — Oct 2025 increases causing temporary churn spike; watching closely |
| **Market saturation** | High | High | 🟡 Weak — connected fitness TAM uncertain; Peloton strategy assumes premium segment defensible |
| **Execution complexity** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — Peter Stern has simplified strategy to four pillars; comp aligned |

---

### FY26 Guidance (Updated Nov 2025)

| Metric | FY26 Guidance | Change vs. FY25 |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Total Revenue | $2.4-2.5B | -2% at midpoint |
| Adj. EBITDA | $425-475M | +12% at midpoint |
| Free Cash Flow | ≥$250M | -23% but from exceptionally strong FY25 |
| Gross Margin | 52% | +110 bps |
| Net Churn | Flat YoY | Stabilization target |
| Operating Income | **Positive (full year)** | First time in company history |

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Risk-opportunity matrix** with probability on Y-axis and impact on X-axis:
- Upper right quadrant (high probability, high impact): Subscriber erosion, market saturation
- Upper left (low probability, high impact): International expansion
- Lower right (high probability, medium impact): LTV extension, content licensing
- Include management's mitigation quality as color coding

---

### Actionable Insight: Three Board-Level Recommendations

#### **Recommendation 1: Monitor Content Licensing Revenue as Leading Indicator**
Content licensing (Lululemon, Hyatt, etc.) represents Peloton's ability to monetize its content platform beyond hardware sales — the core premise of the strategic pivot. This metric is not currently broken out separately in financials.

> **Board Action**: Request quarterly reporting on content licensing revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue. Establish a target (e.g., 10% by FY27) and flag any quarters where it declines.

---

#### **Recommendation 2: Establish Subscriber Floor Threshold**
The current profitability model depends on maintaining a subscriber base large enough to cover fixed costs. Management has not disclosed the minimum viable subscriber count.

> **Board Action**: Work with management to define a "subscriber floor" — the threshold below which the cost structure would need further adjustment. Estimate: ~2.3-2.5M subscribers. If projected trajectory approaches this floor, trigger formal strategic review.

---

#### **Recommendation 3: Demand Concrete Growth Metrics by Q2 FY26**
Peter Stern has articulated a compelling vision but has not provided quantified growth targets. The board should not accept another quarter of "inflection toward growth" language without supporting metrics.

> **Board Action**: In the February 2026 earnings review, require management to present:
> - Target gross additions by channel (direct, third-party retail, commercial)
> - Expected customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel
> - LTV/CAC ratio targets by customer segment
> - Timeline for revenue growth inflection (specific quarter, not "sometime in FY26")

---

### What Success Looks Like (12-Month Scorecard)

| Metric | RED Trigger | AMBER Watch | GREEN Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Ending Subscribers (Jun 2026) | <2.5M | 2.5-2.7M | >2.7M |
| Content Licensing as % Sub Revenue | <3% | 3-5% | >5% |
| Gross Additions (FY26) | Down >15% YoY | Down 5-15% | Flat or positive |
| Free Cash Flow | <$200M | $200-250M | >$250M |
| Churn (Full Year) | >1.8% | 1.6-1.8% | ≤1.6% |

---

### Speaker Notes

The strategic question facing Peloton is whether it can transition from a "stabilized decline" trajectory to a "sustainable growth" trajectory. Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent approach to this challenge: extend the lifetime value of existing members through AI personalization and loyalty programs, while diversifying distribution through commercial/B2B channels and content licensing partnerships.

The early indicators are genuinely positive. Engagement is up 50% since October, Club Peloton has attracted over 500,000 participants, and member satisfaction scores have improved dramatically. The new Cross Training Series hardware has received positive reviews. These are the foundations for retention improvement.

However, the board should maintain appropriate skepticism about growth claims. Every initiative Peter Stern has announced is oriented toward making existing members more engaged and valuable — which is necessary but not sufficient for revenue growth. The company has not yet articulated a convincing plan to reverse the decline in new customer acquisition.

The three recommendations I've outlined are designed to give the board early warning signals if the strategy isn't working. Content licensing revenue is the clearest indicator of platform value beyond hardware. The subscriber floor establishes a boundary condition that would require strategic intervention. And demanding concrete growth metrics ensures management accountability.

If the February 2026 earnings call does not include quantified targets for acquisition and growth — with specific timelines and supporting unit economics — the board should consider whether the current strategy is capable of producing growth, or whether Peloton should be managed as a cash-generating business with a declining revenue trajectory.

## Design Guidelines

- Color palette: Use Peloton brand colors (red/coral accent) sparingly against dark background
- Typography: Clean sans-serif (system fonts fine)
- Charts: Minimal gridlines, clear labels, tooltips on hover
- Transitions: Subtle animations for interactivity, not distracting
- Layout: Single scroll page with sticky navigation

## Deliverable

Generate the complete HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript inline. The dashboard should be immediately deployable to GitHub Pages with no modifications needed.

After generating, provide:

1. The complete HTML code
2. Instructions for GitHub Pages deployment
3. A list of any placeholder text I need to replace with my actual insights

---

## CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED AFTER SLIDE CONTENT IS FINALIZED:

Replace all [INSERT KEY INSIGHT...] placeholders with the actual insights from your Claude-generated slides. The story panels are what connect the data visualization to the "so what" — they're critical for making this more than just charts.
--- End of content ---

---

## USER 🧑‍💻

IGNORE single page. It will have to be multiple pages. just as long as index html is there. Also, please follow the rest of my initial prompt

---

## MODEL ✨

I will create the necessary directory structure for the multi-page website and then proceed to implement the dashboard files (HTML, CSS, JS) using the data and insights provided.

Step 1: Create directories.
Step 2: Create `js/data.js` containing the hardcoded financial and operational data.
Step 3: Create `css/style.css` for the dark "financial terminal" aesthetic.
Step 4: Create `js/dashboard.js` for Chart.js logic and interactivity.
Step 5: Create `index.html` assembling the dashboard with the specific insights from the board presentation.

First, creating the directories.**Tool Command**:

## MODEL ✨

Now I will create `js/dashboard.js`. This script will use Chart.js to render the charts defined in the prompt. I will need to ensure it references the `pelotonData` object from `data.js`. I will also add the logic for the Source Viewer side panel.

Key charts to implement:
1.  **Revenue Trajectory**: Combo bar/line (Total Rev vs Sub % or Sub Rev).
2.  **Profitability Journey**: Line with fill (EBITDA, FCF).
3.  **Operational Restructuring**: Horizontal bar (Employees, Retail Count).
4.  **Subscriber Metrics**: Dual axis (Subs vs Churn).
5.  **Execution Scorecard**: Table generation.
6.  **Opp/Risk Tables**: Table generation.

I will interpret the "Story Panel" interaction as clicking the panel or a specific icon to open the source viewer.**Tool Command**:

## MODEL ✨

Finally, I will create `index.html`. This file will tie everything together. I will follow the layout described in the prompt and ensure to inject the "Story Panels" with the actual insights I extracted from `peloton-board-presentation.md`.

**Key Insights Insertion Plan:**
- **Revenue Story**: "Revenue mix transformed from 78% hardware (FY21) to 67% subscription (FY25). This is not shrinkage—it's transformation."
- **Profitability Story**: "Adjusted EBITDA swung $1.4B from FY22 lows to +$404M in FY25. Free cash flow improved by $816M."
- **Restructuring Story**: "Headcount reduced by 26% since FY23. Exited ALL owned manufacturing (partnered with Rexon) and shifted to 3PL logistics."
- **Credibility Story**: "Management has a consistent track record of beating guidance (5 consecutive quarters). Cost discipline is GREEN; Growth is RED."
- **Subscriber Story**: "Subscriber base eroding (Peak ~3.0M → 2.80M). Churn up to 1.6%. New customer acquisition engine is stalling."
- **Growth Story**: "Opportunities in Content Licensing and B2B are high impact. LTV extension via 'Peloton IQ' shows early promise (Engagement up 50%)."
- **Risk Story**: "Subscriber erosion is the critical trip-wire. <2.5M subs triggers strategic review."

I will now write the `index.html`. I will include the Chart.js library via CDN as requested ("No external dependencies that require build steps" -> CDN is fine for browser-side). I will place it in the head or end of body. The prompt said "No external dependencies that require build steps", usually implies standard script tags. I will use the CDN.**Tool Command**:

## MODEL ✨

I have completed the creation of the Peloton Business Intelligence Dashboard.
1.  Created the directory structure `css/` and `js/`.
2.  Created `js/data.js` with the financial, subscriber, and operational data, plus source citations.
3.  Created `css/style.css` implementing the dark financial terminal theme.

Don't forget, once you've completed the basics as per the prompt, you'll need to review each analysis file individually to add extra pages or dashboards. Don't forget to keep committing changes so we can rollback as necessary.

## MODEL ✨

I'll organize the loose financial documents within the `sources` folder by creating dedicated subdirectories (`8-k`, `10-k`, `10-q`, `proxy-statements`) and moving the respective files into them.

```json
{
  "name": "run_shell_command",
  "args": {
    "command": "cd \"peloton-presentation/sources\"\nmkdir 8-k, 10-k, 10-q, proxy-statements\nMove-Item \"8-k *.pdf\" -Destination 8-k\nMove-Item \"annual report 10k *.pdf\" -Destination 10-k\nMove-Item \"quarterly 10-q *.pdf\" -Destination 10-q\nMove-Item \"PROXY STATEMENT *.pdf\" -Destination proxy-statements"

## USER 🧑‍💻

following the GEMINI.md instructions, I would like you to initialise he peloton-presentation folder to Github. There is no index.html file yet, so please create a placeholder page and publish to GitHub Pages. Create a gitignore file with standard defaults. Push all current docs and files.

---

## MODEL ✨

I will initialize the `peloton-presentation` folder as a GitHub repository with a placeholder website, following the defined workflow.

First, I will create the `index.html` and `.gitignore` files.

## MODEL ✨

I have successfully initialized the `peloton-presentation` project and published it to GitHub.

**Summary of Actions:**
1.  **Created Placeholder:** Added a standard `index.html` to serve as the entry point.
2.  **Configured Git:** Created a `.gitignore` with standard defaults.
3.  **Initialized & Pushed:** Initialized the local repository, committed all files (including the `sources` folder), and pushed to the new remote repository: [obriedan/peloton-presentation](https://github.com/obriedan/peloton-presentation).
4.  **Enabled GitHub Pages:** The site is now live (or will be shortly) at:
    👉 **https://obriedan.github.io/peloton-presentation/**

The project is fully set up and compliant with the `GEMINI.md` workflow.

## USER 🧑‍💻

Please diagnose the git command failures. They worked the last time we worked on projects in this business intelligence folder, without issue.

## MODEL ✨

I will run a few checks to see why the `git` command wasn't found in my environment, comparing my current session's `PATH` against your system's permanent configuration.

### Diagnosis

The diagnostic output confirms exactly why the commands failed:

1.  **Missing from Registry:** The path `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` is **completely missing** from your computer's permanent configuration (both "System" and "User" levels).
2.  **Only GitHub CLI Exists:** While `GitHub CLI` is present in your PATH, standard `Git` is not.

**Why did it work before?**
Since the path is missing from the registry, it's likely that:
*   **Git was re-installed or updated:** Sometimes installers overwrite the `PATH` variable rather than appending to it, accidentally removing previous entries.
*   **Or, a temporary setup was used:** In the previous session, an environment script (like `vcvars64.bat` or a specific terminal profile) might have temporarily injected Git into the session, but that configuration doesn't persist to a generic command shell.

**Recommendation:**
To fix this permanently for all applications (including me and your own terminals):
1.  Open **"Edit the system environment variables"** in Windows Search.
2.  Click **Environment Variables**.
3.  Under **System variables**, find `Path`, click **Edit**, and add:
    `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`

For our current session, I will continue to manually inject it so we can proceed without interruption.

## USER 🧑‍💻

Are there alternative methods to resolve this issue? Could we npm install git ? When I installed Git initially it installed the Git GUI. But this is the first time I have run into this issue with the git command.

---

## MODEL ✨

I will quickly check if Git is installed in your local user directory, which is another common location that might have been dropped from the PATH.

**Tool Command**:
```json
{
  "name": "run_shell_command",
  "args": {
    "description": "Check for Git in the local user AppData folder.",
    "command": "Test-Path \"$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Programs\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe\""
  }
}
```

### Answer

**Can you `npm install git`?**
**No.** `npm` is for JavaScript libraries. While there are some packages named "git", they are usually just wrappers or pure-JS implementations (like `isomorphic-git`) used *inside* a Node.js project. They do not install the system-wide `git.exe` tool that your terminal or VS Code needs.

### Why this is happening now
Since you mentioned installing the **Git GUI**, it is highly likely that during installation, the option **"Use Git from Git Bash only"** was selected (often the default) instead of **"Git from the command line"**. This keeps your PATH clean but makes `git` invisible to PowerShell and other tools.

### Best Alternative Solutions

Here are the best ways to fix this without manually editing environment variables:

**1. Re-run the Git Installer (Easiest & Safest)**
Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win). When you run it, simply click "Next" until you see the screen **"Adjusting your PATH environment"**.
*   **Select:** "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software".
*   This will fix it permanently for all tools.

**2. Use "Git Bash" Terminal**
If you have Git GUI installed, you almost certainly have **Git Bash** installed.
*   Open your Start Menu and search for "Git Bash".
*   This is a special terminal where `git` is guaranteed to work. You can type commands there just like in PowerShell.

**3. Use a Windows Package Manager (Automated)**
If you use Chocolatey or Winget, you can force a reinstall that sets the path correctly:
*   **Winget:** `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`
*   **Chocolatey:** `choco install git`

For our current session, I will continue to manually locate Git so I can keep working for you without you needing to pause and reinstall anything.

I will use `winget` to check the installation details of Git, which will help us understand why it's not appearing in your PATH despite being installed.

**Tool Command**:
```json

    "command": "winget list --id Git.Git",
    "description": "Check winget for Git installation status."
  }

## MODEL ✨

It is definitely installed. The fact that UniGetUI/Winget shows it but the terminal can't find it confirms that the **environment variables** just weren't updated (or require a full system restart to refresh).

Since you have UniGetUI/Winget, you can try this "soft fix" which often triggers a PATH refresh in Windows:

### The "Winget Repair" Method
In your terminal (or I can run it), run this command. It tells Winget to essentially "re-register" the application:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git --force
```

**Why this usually works:**
When Winget runs a "force" install on an already installed package, it re-runs the installer's post-install scripts, which includes writing the `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` entry back into your System PATH.

### A Note on Versions
You are on **v2.52.0**, which is very up-to-date. If the "force" install doesn't work, it means the installer is specifically configured *not* to touch the PATH. 

**Would you like me to attempt the `winget` force-install for you now?** (Note: You might see a Windows UAC popup to approve the installer).

## USER 🧑‍💻

I ran that command and reinstalled git, there was no prompt regarding the PATH.

---

## MODEL ✨

I will check the system registry's PATH variable one more time to see if the Winget re-install silently updated it.

**Tool Command**:
```json
{
  "name": "run_shell_command",
  "args": {
    "description": "Check if the system registry PATH now includes Git.",
    "command": "Write-Host \"--- System Registry PATH (After Winget Re-install) ---\"\n[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \"Machine\") -split ';' | Select-String \"Git\""
  }

  }
}
```

---

## MODEL ✨

### Success!
The `winget` command worked. You can see the entry `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` is now present in your System Registry.

**Why it might still fail in your current window:**
Terminals (including the one I am running in) only load the PATH **once** when they start. They don't see changes made to the registry *after* they opened.

**How to fix it for yourself:**
Restart your terminal (VS Code, PowerShell, etc.), and `git` will work perfectly.

**How I will proceed:**
For this session, I will continue to manually inject the path so we don't need to restart me. I'm ready to continue with your Business Intelligence projects. What would you like to do next?

It seems `tree` is also triggering a parsing error in PowerShell when combined with the path string in that specific way, or it's a conflict with the `.` operator again.

## MODEL ✨

The PowerShell commands failed due to escaping issues with the backticks in the string values. However, the `cmd /c tree` command succeeded, but likely into a file that wasn't properly initialized because the first command failed.

I will use `write_file` to manually construct the content. I'll get the tree output first into a temporary variable/file or just read the file I successfully appended to, and then rewrite the whole thing cleanly.

Actually, the `cmd /c tree ...` command *did* execute successfully (Exit Code: 0). Let me read what's currently in `peloton-presentation\files_list.md` to see what I'm working with. It might just be the tree output without the header.

That is unexpected; `tree` output should be text, but sometimes encoding issues make it appear binary to the tool.

# <a id="src-main"></a> FY2025 Strategic Outlook and Financial Performance Targets

Based on the Q1 FY2025 earnings call transcript, management provided the following specific guidance and targets.

### **1\. Full Year FY2025 Targets**

Management reiterated some prior guidance while raising targets for Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.

*   **Total Revenue:** "Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at **$2.4 billion to $2.5 billion**"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** The outlook "remains unchanged at **49%**"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** Management raised the guidance range by 40million.LizCoddingtonstated : "WeareraisingourFY^{′}25adjustedEBITDAguidance...to ∗ ∗240 million to $290 million\*\*"[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** "We are also raising our free cash flow target to **at least $125 million** an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance"[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** The guidance range of "**2.68 million to 2.75 million** remains unchanged"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Paid App Subscriptions:** Management lowered this guidance by 20,000 subscriptions to a range of "**550,000 to 600,000**"[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Churn:** Management expects "average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to **increase modestly year over year**"[[Source 3]](#src-3).

### **2\. Q2 FY2025 Expectations**

For the second quarter, management provided specific ranges reflecting seasonal trends and increased marketing spend.

*   **Total Revenue:** "**$640 million to $660 million**," which reflects a sequential increase due to holiday hardware sales[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** "**2.84 million to 2.86 million**," reflecting a "sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint"[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **Paid App Subscriptions:** "**560,000 to 580,000**," reflecting a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** "**46.5%**," which reflects an expected sequential decline "as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment"[[Source 5]](#src-5).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** "**$20 million to $30 million**," reflecting a sequential decline mainly due to "higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Churn:** Management expects the churn rate to "**slightly improve sequentially** in Q2"[[Source 6]](#src-6).

### **3\. Cost Restructuring Milestones**

Management confirmed they are on track to meet the savings goals announced in the May 2024 restructuring plan.

*   **Total Run-Rate Savings:** Interim Co-CEO Karen Boone reiterated the goal of "delivering **over $200 million of run rate cost savings** by the end of fiscal year '25"[[Source 7]](#src-7).
*   **Payroll-Related Savings (Completed):** CFO Liz Coddington confirmed that as of the end of Q1, they have "actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver **over $100 million of annualized run rate savings**"[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **Additional Efficiencies:** Management noted they are realizing some savings "faster than we anticipated" and finding "additional cost efficiency through **reductions to media spend** that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals"[[Source 8]](#src-8).

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

I truly cannot wait to officially welcome him to Peloton at the start of the calendar year. Turning to our financial results. I'm extremely pleased to share that we are reiterating our fiscal 2025 financial goals today, which include: first, aligning our cost structure to the current size of our business by delivering over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal year '25 from our cost restructuring plan announced in May 2024. Second, improving our unit economics across all products and sales channels in pursuit of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and meaningful free cash flow generation.

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

# <a id="src-main"></a> FY2026 First Quarter Earnings Performance and Revised Outlook

Based on the **Q1 FY2026 earnings call transcript** (dated November 6, 2025), management focused primarily on the results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 and the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.

The transcript does not contain a retrospective comparison of **FY2025 full-year results** against the guidance given at the start of FY2025, as that period had closed in the previous quarter. However, management provided extensive details regarding their **Q1 FY2026 performance** against guidance and updated their **FY2026 full-year outlook**.

### 1\. Q1 FY2026 Performance vs. Guidance

Management reported that the company exceeded expectations on most metrics for the first quarter of FY2026.

*   **Total Revenue:** **Beat.** Reported 551million ∗ ∗,\\, outperformingthehighendoftheguidancerangeby ∗ ∗**6 million**[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** **Beat.** Ended with **2.732 million**, exceeding the high end of guidance by **2,000**[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** **Beat.** Reported 118million ∗ ∗,\\, whichwas ∗ ∗**18 million above** the high end of the guidance range[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** **Beat.** Generated **$67 million**, which management noted was "significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** **Missed.** Reported **51.5%**, which was **50 basis points below** the guidance of 52%. Management attributed this miss to a specific one-time charge: "Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs"[[Source 4]](#src-4).

### 2\. New Guidance Provided for FY2026

In the Q1 FY2026 call, management **raised** their full-year guidance for Profitability (EBITDA), Gross Margin, and Free Cash Flow, while maintaining their Revenue outlook.

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

Liz Coddington Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Subscription revenue decreased $28 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, lower content licensing revenue and lower ending paid app subscriptions, partly offset by used equipment activation fee revenue, which was introduced in late August of fiscal 2025. Total gross profit was $284 million in Q1, a decrease of $20 million or 7% year-over-year. Total gross margin was 51.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points below our guidance of 52%. Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs this quarter, in addition to $3 million we accrued in the prior quarter, representing a total estimated impact of $16.5 million. Excluding this $13.5 million charge in Q1, total gross margin would have been 54% or 200 basis points above our Q1 guidance.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

# <a id="src-6"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 6)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

# <a id="src-7"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 7)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

# <a id="src-8"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 8)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

*   **Deleveraging:** The company expects to make meaningful progress deleveraging the balance sheet through FY2025 and beyond, specifically mentioning the paydown of **~$200M** in convertible notes due in February 2026[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 20]](#src-20).
*   **Restructuring:** The "2025 Restructuring Plan" (announced Aug 2025) is expected to be substantially implemented by the end of Fiscal 2026, targeting **$100M** in run-rate savings[[Source 21]](#src-21)[[Source 22]](#src-22).

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Really helpful. And maybe one just follow-up on Connected Fitness gross profit, gross margin sort of reaching that double-digit sort of milestone for the first time is a great hurdle to clear, but we think that you still are always away from where you think this can go over time. Any context as to sort of where you see the upper band on Connected Fitness product gross margin and the levers you have there to sort of pull those higher going forward?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So our improvements in Connected Fitness gross margin are due to -- there's multiple dimensions to that. Some of that is mixed into some of our more premium products that do have a higher gross margin and then some of that is also just being more optimized in how we offer discounts. And then we've also made some pricing changes.

So we can continue to pull all of those levers over time. And we do expect our gross margins can -- that they can continue to expand. I'm not going to give you a specific target for that, but we know that there is more opportunity to expand them over time. And we do expect for the remainder just to clarify, for Q3 and the full year for fiscal '25, at least, we do expect to maintain double-digit Connected Fitness product gross margins primarily because we are shifting toward those higher-margin products and being really disciplined about our promotions.

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

# <a id="src-12"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 12)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

Subscription gross margin was 68.6%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. Total operating expenses, excluding restructuring, impairment and supplier settlement expenses were $230 million in Q1, a decrease of $30 million or 12% year-over-year, reflecting the continued progress we've made in rightsizing our cost structure as well as a reduction to advertising expenses in Q1 ahead of our hardware portfolio refresh announced on October 1. We are on track to achieve our target to deliver at least $100 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2026. Sales and marketing expenses were $67 million in Q1, a decrease of $15 million or 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by decreases in acquisition, brand and creative marketing spend as well as a decrease in retail showroom expenses. As of the end of Q1, we had 7 legacy retail showrooms remaining.

Please refer to Annex A for descriptions and reconciliations for each above non-GAAP financial measure (Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA) to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

In Fiscal 2026, we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies and managing the business toward profitable growth, while investing in product and content innovation to drive long-term growth. Our goals include to:

*   achieve at least $200 million of Free Cash Flow;
*   achieve at least $100 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of Fiscal 2026;
*   launch new product and content offerings focused on holistic wellness, including a portfolio of refreshed hardware products;
*   form a unified commercial business unit by integrating Precor and Peloton for Business;
*   grow our physical and online retail presence cost-effectively via third party retail partners and flexible, capital-efficient microstores;

We do anticipate our full year fiscal '26 product Connected Fitness product gross margins to increase year-over-year. And then in terms of a long-term target, you mentioned double digits. Our goal is eventually to be in around the 20s range, and we intend to make progress towards that in the fiscal year. I do want to point out, though, as we've talked about on many prior calls, that we will continue to make trade-offs between gross margin and marketing spend based on the LTV to CAC efficiency that we see. Now Peter, did you want to talk a little bit -- I can talk about marketing.

# <a id="src-18"></a>Source: q1 2025 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 18)

We've become much more disciplined in our media spending and a lot more focused on where are those qualified growth audiences. So, all of these areas, I'm really impressed with what Lauren and her team have done and the way they, I think, set up Peloton as part of this broader effort at the company to create a solid foundation of sustainable and profitable growth. So, you can expect that to continue.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

So, on the question around the LTV to CAC and the path back to getting to that 2x to 3x. So, our goal is to get to that 2 to 3x range, ideally closer to 3, we do have some work to get there. We're not quite there yet. And we have these near-term levers that we are focused on that are under our control.

And then as Chris was talking a lot about investing in future growth. So, the pricing changes that we've made and the reduced promotional activity that you saw in Q1 are way for us to improve our gross margins. So, we made progress on those in Q1 and as we go into Q2, we will still have promotions over the holidays, but we will continue to make progress on our LTV by improving our gross margins over time. And ultimately, our goal is to get to where we have significant positive gross margins across all products, all channels, and all markets.

# <a id="src-19"></a>Source: q2 2025 earnings transcript.md (Citation 19)

This campaign resonated well with men. In Q2, 42% of Connected Fitness Subscription gross additions were men, a 280-basis-point increase quarter over quarter and 240 basis points increase year over year. In addition to advertising more toward men, our marketing efforts were also focused on demonstrating the full value of the Peloton membership through better education of our extensive offerings. Among the Latine and core female audiences exposed to our holiday campaign, we observed a lift in awareness of non-cycling modalities like walking, running, yoga, and high-intensity interval training.

We also saw an increased in the Latine audience that would consider using Peloton, which is a leading indicator of future intent to purchase. Alongside reaching new audiences and introducing additional disciplines to our members, we continue to make progress on improving our marketing efficiency which we measure from a lens of our LTV to CAC ratio. While our LTV to CAC remains in the range of one to two times, we have made progress year over year toward our target to reach at least two times and ideally closer to three times. Our Q2 LTV to CAC was roughly 15% higher than Q2 fiscal 2024.

Similarly, our net leverage ratio, defined as gross principal debt outstanding net of cash and cash equivalents divided by trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 1.1 in Q1, down from 7.5 in Q1 of last year. We believe we have more cash on the balance sheet today than we need to run the business and are evaluating opportunities to optimize our capital structure over time. In February 2026, roughly $200 million of 0% convertible notes will come due, and we intend to pay them down at that time. It's also worth noting our $1 billion term loan has a 1% call premium through May of 2026. We are mindful of the timing of when this call premium expires as we evaluate our options. We expect a refinancing to deliver a lower cost of capital and more flexibility to our capital allocation strategy.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

Upon full implementation, we expect the 2025 Restructuring Plan to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2026.

We may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the Restructuring Plans, and implementation and transition _costs may be greater than expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K._

And third, continuing to make strategic investments in innovation to enable Peloton to return to top-line growth in the long term. This includes product development in both software and hardware features, refining our marketing strategy to attract new audiences, as well as evolving our content offering to deliver more diversified, engaging fitness experiences. We believe these efforts will delight our current members and attract new ones to our strong and loyal community. Our Q1 results were strong, exceeding our guidance on all key metrics, which Liz will discuss in greater detail.

Progress on cost reduction efforts are reflected in our profitability metrics. We are proud to report Q1 results, which include $13 million of GAAP operating income, $11 million of free cash flow, and $116 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our results also highlight the continued strength of our category-leading connected fitness subscription business, which has over 6 million loyal members, 2.9 million connected fitness subscribers, 586,000 app subscribers and over $1.7 billion of annualized subscription revenue was 68% gross margin. I am thrilled to see our cost reduction efforts materialize in our financial performance to date.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

We ended the quarter with 2.9 million paid connected fitness subscribers, reflecting a net decrease of 81,000 in the quarter. This exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10,000 subscribers. The main driver of our subscriber outperformance was slightly favorable churn versus our expectations as a result of fewer subscription pauses. This favorability was partly offset by slightly softer gross additions than we expected.

Average net monthly paid connected fitness subscription churn was 1.9%, slightly favorable versus expectations and in line with the prior quarter and an increase of roughly 40 basis points year over year. As a reminder, our net churn performance from the year-ago period included a one-time benefit as a result of elevated subscription unpauses in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, following elevated pauses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 in response to our original bike seatpost recall. We ended the first quarter with 582,000 paid app subscriptions, reflecting a net decrease of 33,000 in the quarter. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 12,000 from both higher additions and better-than-expected average monthly paid app subscription churn, which was 7.1% in the quarter.

In the first quarter, we've continued to scale back the amount of media spend dedicated to support growth in paid app subscriptions to maximize media efficiency. As we continue evolving our app with software enhancements, such as personalized plans and Private Teams, and developing new app offerings like our Strength Plus beta. We may elect to invest more in-app media if we see signals that suggest we can accelerate growth of app subscribers efficiently. Total revenue was $586 million in the first quarter, comprising $160 million of connected fitness products revenue and $426 million of subscription revenue.

connected fitness products revenue was down 12% year over year due to lower hardware demand and subscription revenue was up 3% year over year due to content licensing revenue from lululemon and Google Fitbit. Total revenue was above the high end of our $560 million to $580 million guidance range, primarily due to higher subscription revenue as a result of higher paid connected fitness and paid app subscribers than we expected, as well as slightly higher connected fitness products revenue. As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonally lower period for hardware sales, which is reflected in the revenue mix of 27% connected fitness and 73% subscription for the quarter. Total gross profit was $304 million in the first quarter, an increase of $18 million or 6% year over year.

This quarter, we recognized $8 million of impairment and restructuring expense, of which $5 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exit. The cash charges consisted of $3 million in exit and disposal costs and professional fees, offset by a $0.5 million net benefit from lower severance and other personnel costs. We also recognized $24 million of supplier settlements due to accruals in the first quarter related to settlement of a dispute with a third-party supplier.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

The progress made so far shows in our profitability where we achieved meaningful improvements in Q2. Both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow increased roughly $140 million year over year. This enabled us to make meaningful progress deleveraging our balance sheet with net debt decreasing over $280 million or 30% year over year. All this is to say that while we are working on our long-term growth strategy, for fiscal '26 and beyond, our financial goals for fiscal '25 and continued discipline toward improving gross margins, reducing operating costs, and deleveraging our balance sheet are and will remain top priorities for me.

Now I'll turn it over to Liz to discuss our Q2 results.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. We are pleased with our second quarter results as we exceeded our guidance on key metrics and continued to make meaningful progress improving unit economics and profitability. We also made progress on our marketing objectives by improving LTV to CAC year over year and elevating Tread with Target audiences. We ended the quarter with 2.88 million Paid Connected Fitness subscription reflecting a net decrease of 21,000 in the quarter.

Second, we continue to see a slight headwind to churn as a result of subscription mix shift toward the secondary market, which has a higher churn profile than subscriptions that purchase their hardware directly from us or our channel partners. Favorable churn was partially offset by lower gross additions due to slightly lower hardware unit sales, a higher mix of Tread portfolio sales, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products, and longer delivery times for Tread+ units that delayed subscription activations until Q3. Secondary market activations were in line with internal expectations and represented roughly 40% of total gross additions in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with 579,000 Paid App subscriptions inclusive of Strength+ subscription, reflecting a net decrease of 4,000 in the quarter.

This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 9,000. Total revenue was $674 million in the second quarter, comprising $253 million of Connected Fitness Products revenue, a decrease of $66 million or 21% year over year, and $421 million of Subscription Revenue, a decrease of $4 million or 1% year over year. Total revenue was $14 million above the high end of our $640 million to $660 million guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenue from both segments. The holiday season is a critical period for Connected Fitness products revenue as Q2 has historically represented over 40% of annual hardware unit sales.

Research and development expenses were $60 million, a decrease of $20 million or 25% year over year, primarily driven by lower employee related and contractor expenses. In Q2, we recognized $20 million of impairment and restructuring expenses, of which $17 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exits. The cash charges consisted of $3 million of severance and other exit and disposal costs as we continue executing on our restructuring efforts.

Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the second quarter, which was $28 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $140 million improvement year over year. We generated $106 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, an improvement of $95 million quarter over quarter and $143 million year over year, and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $829 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $107 million quarter over quarter. We continue to make progress toward deleveraging our balance sheet as net debt reduced $281 million or 30% year over year.

Liz Coddington Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

# <a id="src-10"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 10)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint.

Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton Fiscal Strategy and Guidance Adjustments 2025-2026

Based on the earnings transcripts provided for Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026, Peloton management has frequently adjusted guidance. The trend across these periods shows a consistent pattern of **raising profitability and cash flow targets** due to cost discipline, while revenue and subscriber guidance has been more mixed or narrowed.

Here is the breakdown of instances where guidance was raised, lowered, or declined.

### 1\. Instances where Management **Raised** Guidance

Management raised guidance in three consecutive earnings calls reported in the documents, primarily driven by accelerated cost savings and improved unit economics.

### 2\. Instances where Management **Lowered** Guidance

Management lowered guidance in only one specific instance within the provided transcripts, related to App subscriptions.

*   **Q1 FY2025 Call (Oct 31, 2024):**
    *   **Metric:** FY2025 Paid App Subscriptions.
    *   **Decrease:** Lowered by **20,000 subscriptions** (New range: 550k–600k).
    *   **Reason:** Management made a strategic decision to limit media spend for the App while investing in product development to improve the member experience before spending to acquire new users[[Source 11]](#src-11).

### 3\. Instances where Management **Declined** or **Withdrew** Guidance

Management explicitly declined to provide specific guidance on certain metrics, citing uncertainty or internal policy.

    *   **Declined to Guide:** When asked for specific churn numbers for the remainder of the year, CFO Liz Coddington stated, "We don't guide specifically to churn," though she provided directional expectations that churn would remain relatively in line with Q2 levels[[Source 13]](#src-13).
*   **Subscription Pricing Plans (Q2 FY2025):**
    *   **Declined to Guide:** When asked how investors should think about potential price increases, CEO Peter Stern declined to provide specifics, stating, "We won't take any actions there lightly. So beyond what I've shared so far, that's about all we have to say today"[[Source 14]](#src-14)[[Source 15]](#src-15).

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

# <a id="src-10"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 10)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

It was up 40 basis points year over year. As we discussed during the last quarter earnings call, we expected Q1 net churn to be up year over year due to a few reasons, including the following: slightly worse overall retention from our 1P and 3P subscriber base, which we've talked about, mix shift toward secondary market subscribers, which do have a slightly lower retention than our first-party subscribers. And then we also had the impact of a one-time benefit in Q1 of fiscal '24 related to higher subscription on pauses following elevated pauses in Q4 of fiscal '23 related to our original bike seatpost recall, and we did not repeat that benefit this year. As we move forward and look at Q2, we do expect our churn to improve seasonally compared to Q1 and we do expect that improvement would likely be a bit muted though compared to quarter-over-quarter improvement that we saw in fiscal '24, again, because of those two headwinds that I mentioned about the slightly worse retention in our overall subscriber base and that mix shift into secondary subscriptions, which do have that higher churn profile.

So, overall, for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our churn to continue to be higher year over year because of the mix of subscribers from the secondary market continuing to grow but we do expect churn to remain below 2% for the whole of fiscal 2025. I do want to point out though, and we've mentioned this before, that our guidance doesn't assume any potential upside to subscriber retention as a result of the software innovation initiatives that Chris talked about earlier, which we believe could positively impact member engagement and ultimately, retention over time. And the reason we haven't incorporated those is because the magnitude and timing of those benefits is uncertain at this point.

# <a id="src-13"></a>Source: q2 2025 earnings transcript.md (Citation 13)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

And so with the passage of time, that benefits our churn. The second thing is looking at engagements. Peloton is that rare brand that makes you healthier the more you use it. And so one of our goals is to get more people using our product more and we're pleased to see here some growth in our engagement levels in terms of the average monthly workout time for ending Connected Fitness subscription if we look at that on a year-over-year basis.

So we've got a healthy customer base. We've got healthy usage. As I mentioned earlier, we have strong NPS scores, and that all adds up to healthy churn. Liz maybe you want to provide a little more color?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

I can provide a little bit more color on the outlook. I think you were asking a little bit more. We're not -- we don't guide specifically to churn, but we can -- I can tell you that in Q3, we do expect our average month -- net monthly paid Connected Fitness churn rate to remain relatively in line with Q2. And then just on a full-year basis, we do continue to expect our churn rate to increase modestly year-over-over.

# <a id="src-14"></a>Source: q2 2025 earnings transcript.md (Citation 14)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

You talked a lot about improving churn. I was wondering, is it fair to assume that this better-than-expected churn, which is probably not as much of a surprise to you as to us, given the efforts you've taken to get there? My question is, how should we think about potential price increases in light of improving churn? It seems like you feel better about churn today than you did three months ago. First, is that a fair assumption? Second, how should we think about sort of price increases in the subscription business in light of improving churn? Then I have a quick follow-up.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Arpine, thanks for the question. And we obviously -- we feel good about the churn that we just reported, and Liz just talked you through a little bit about how we're thinking about it for the rest of the year. With regard to pricing, to state the obvious, pricing is a powerful lever with every change up or down, essentially dropping straight to the bottom line. So we're taking a hard look at pricing alongside everything else in our business.

As a reminder, in Q1, we took steps to improve our unit economics by taking up the price of our rower in North America, and we also raised prices for Bike and Bike+ in our international markets. This holiday season, we also improved our hardware unit economics by reducing the number of days that we were on promotion and by structuring our promotional strategy to better align with the margin profile of our products. So all of that added up to greater discipline, as well as some terrific learning opportunities for us around pricing. I think a question that might be in everybody's mind is around subscription pricing, and we know how important subscription pricing is to our members, as well as to the performance of the business, and we won't take any actions there lightly.

So beyond what I've shared so far, that's about all we have to say today, but we'll share more about pricing when we're ready to.

Arpine Kocharyan -- Analyst

Wonderful. Great. Peter, I was wondering if you could share your initial impression of where your see low-hanging fruit in terms of further cost optimization. Do you feel that that's first in hardware COGS versus more in sort of opex and the obvious sort of G&A that you've talked about before in terms of being higher than it's supposed to be? Where do you see that low-hanging fruit as you sort of look at the business with fresh eyes?

_Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024_

Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 decreased $237.1 million, or 25.1%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by fewer Connected Fitness product deliveries, resulting from lower demand during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as well as lower freight and warehousing costs. This decrease was partially offset by higher Precor sales and more Tread+ deliveries during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased $1,405.9 million, or 168.7%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period, our investments in expedited shipping to alleviate our backlog of demand, and increased shipping and component part costs that we expect to carry into the next fiscal year.

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased $196.9 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased inventory reserves in the amount of $222.1 million primarily related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use as a result of our restructuring activities, costs of $169.0 million associated with Precor-branded commercial products, and increased Tread costs of $137.7 million, primarily driven by the launch of Tread in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

_Membership & Member Support Services_ The Membership team, which includes third-party support providers, is focused on driving engagement to help us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscription retention rates. The team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has lapsed. The Membership team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded “Century Club” shirts after a Member’s 100 class. The team also communicates with Members with no recent activity through email campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their workout routine. In addition, the Membership team collects and responds to feedback about our platform that is on our primary Facebook group of over 469,000 Members as of June 30, 2022.

Restructuring Plan In February 2022, we announced and began implementing a restructuring plan to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). The Restructuring Plan includes: (i) reducing our headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for our previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities, and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations. We expect the Restructuring Plan to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal 2024.

On July 12, 2022, we announced we are exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and our expansion of our current relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp. Additionally, on August 12, 2022, we announced our decision to perform the following additional restructuring activities: (i) eliminate our North American Field Ops warehouses, including the significant reduction of our delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminate a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exit our real-estate footprints in our Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reduce our North America retail showroom presence. In connection with the Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash charges of approximately $95.0 million primarily composed of severance and other exit costs in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Additionally, we expect to recognize approximately $75.0 million of asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2023 in connection with the Restructuring Plan.

In July 2022, August 2022 and October 2022, the Company took actions to update the Restructuring Plan. On July 12, 2022, the Company announced it is exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding its current relationship with Taiwanese manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp. Additionally, on August 12, 2022, the Company announced the decision to perform the following restructuring activities: (i) fully transitioning its North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of its delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminating a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exiting its real-estate footprints in its Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reducing its retail showroom presence. On October 6, 2022, the Company announced approximately 500 global team member positions have been eliminated.

We lease our production studio facilities, which are located in New York City and London, and are used to support our Subscription segment. In addition, we lease and sublease field operations and distribution facilities primarily in North America and Europe, which are used to support our Connected Fitness segment.

In May 2021, we announced plans to build a U.S. manufacturing facility in Troy Township, Ohio, which we called "Peloton Output Park" and is where we had planned to manufacture Connected Fitness Products in addition to our existing manufacturing facilities. In February 2022, as part of the 2022 Restructuring Plan, we announced the closing of several assembly and manufacturing plants, including our plans to sell the facility that was intended to be Peloton Output Park. In January 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). We believe that the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount by approximately 15%, which impacted roughly 400 Peloton team members; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

# <a id="src-7"></a>Source: annual report 10k 2024.pdf (Citation 7)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Upon full implementation, we expect the plan to result in reduced annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of fiscal year 2025.

We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair our ability to conduct any of our key business functions. However, we may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the 2022 Restructuring Plan and the 2024 Restructuring Plan, and costs may be greater than _expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business.”_

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

This was especially important in Germany, where we transitioned our operations to an entirely third-party retail and distribution model. This means that while our first-party website will remain live to serve as a brand awareness and product education platform, we are now directing traffic to third-party retailers, namely Amazon and FitShop for sales and fulfillment. Germany sales have outperformed our internal expectations following the third-party transition. We are optimistic that this channel strategy could provide a more capital-efficient model to explore expansion into additional international markets over time.

Paid connected fitness subscribers in our international markets grew 8% in Q1. We remain bullish on international as a source for long-term growth based on the strong retention and engagement trends that mirror those in our North America business. We continue to optimize our sales channel strategy for stronger unit economics in our North American business as well. In Q1, we continued our efforts to close underperforming first-party retail stores.

Next month, we will test the reimagined smaller store concept in Nashville, Tennessee to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model. We also expanded third-party and online retail capabilities ahead of the all-important holiday season. On our website, we launched an exciting partnership with Truemed in early October, which makes it easier for qualified U.S.-based customers to use pre-tax, HSA or FSA dollars to purchase Peloton products. We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, the Peloton Bike Plus will be available at Costco this holiday season with special pricing across 300 U.S.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Total charges related to the Restructuring Plan were $611.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, consisting of cash charges of $109.1 million for severance and other personnel and $15.4 million for professional fees and other related charges, and non-cash charges of $373.8 million related to non-inventory asset write-downs and write-offs, $56.5 million for stock-based compensation expense and $56.4 million for inventory markdowns.

In addition to the above charges, the Company has incurred approximately $86.6 million of capital expenditures related to Peloton Output Park since project inception.

And then third is deepening the connection that we have with our existing members, which, in particular, has the potential to lengthen the lifetimes that we have with our members, which are already impressively long. So again, no specifics today, but that's where to look.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And I'll take the question about the continuing profitability improvement. As you just heard us say a few minutes ago, we did just raise our full-year adjusted EBITDA target for FY '25 by $60 million. And so that is reflecting continued improvements in profitability that we expect largely due to our gross margin expansion that we talked about, as well as continued operating expense savings.

We are on track to exceed our $200 million annualized run rate cost savings plan by the end of fiscal '25 that we committed to in our restructuring plan back in May of 2024. And then on top of that, as we continue to talk about, we are seeing upside from savings in media, which we also expect to be down materially year over year for the remainder of FY '25. And while we're pleased with this progress that we've made, we do see further opportunities for cost optimizations, and we built a culture of cost discipline into our company. We know that our opex as a percent of revenue is still too high overall for the long term and especially that's true within our G&A area.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton: Strategic Pivot and the Path to Growth

Based on the J.P. Morgan analyst reports from August and November 2025, the firm maintains a **Neutral** rating on Peloton. The analysts acknowledge Peloton's status as a market leader with a loyal base but highlight significant challenges regarding the company's ability to return to sustainable top-line growth.

### **Competitive Positioning**

J.P. Morgan positions Peloton as the dominant player in interactive fitness, characterized by a unique vertically integrated business model.

*   **Market Leadership and Scale:** Peloton is identified as the "largest interactive fitness platform in the world" with over 6 million members globally[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2). The analysts note that Peloton's membership represents only ~4% of global gym memberships, suggesting a significant theoretical runway for future growth[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Vertically Integrated Model:** A key competitive advantage identified is Peloton's control over the "entire member journey" through its vertically integrated model (hardware, software, and content). This allows the company to deliver a "members-first mission" and drives a "passionate and highly engaged member base"[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Valuation Discount:** Despite its market leadership, Peloton trades at a discount compared to consumer subscription peers. As of November 2025, the price target of $9.00 is based on ~12x CY27 estimated Free Cash Flow (FCF), representing a discount to peers trading at an average of ~38x due to Peloton's "lower growth & profit profile"[[Source 5]](#src-5).

### **Key Opportunities**

The reports highlight several strategic initiatives implemented by CEO Peter Stern intended to drive profitability and eventually restore growth.

*   **Strategic Pivot to Wellness:** A major opportunity identified is broadening Peloton’s focus beyond cardio fitness to include "wellness." This includes scaling offerings in **Strength** and entering new categories such as **Meditation, Sleep, Recovery, Nutrition, and Hydration**[[Source 6]](#src-6)[[Source 7]](#src-7).
*   **Cost Rationalization and Efficiency:** J.P. Morgan views the company's cost discipline positively. Peloton is on track to realize over **$100 million in annualized savings** by the end of FY2026 through headcount reductions, lower indirect spend, and work relocation[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 9]](#src-9). The analysts are encouraged by the company's progress in improving profit, ramping FCF, and deleveraging the balance sheet[[Source 6]](#src-6)[[Source 10]](#src-10).
*   **Product Innovation:** The analysts point to investments in driving awareness for new products, specifically the **Peloton Cross Training Series** and **Peloton IQ** (AI-driven personalization), as key drivers for future growth[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 11]](#src-11).
*   **Pricing and Monetization:** There is an opportunity to improve unit economics through pricing adjustments. This includes rationalizing promotions, introducing optional expert assembly fees, and potential upside from All-Access subscription price increases[[Source 7]](#src-7)\> <[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13).
*   **Commercial and Retail Expansion:** The creation of a **unified commercial business unit** combining Peloton and Precor is seen as a strategic lever to expand reach[[Source 14]](#src-14). Additionally, the analysts note the plan to expand from one to ten "microstores" to grow physical presence efficiently[[Source 15]](#src-15).

### **Key Threats and Risks**

Despite the operational improvements, J.P. Morgan identifies substantial risks, primarily centered on the uncertainty of demand and intense market competition.

*   **Visibility on Growth:** The most significant threat identified is the difficulty in returning to Connected Fitness (CF) subscriber and revenue growth. The analysts note that "visibility is limited given secular & macro pressures" and that a return to growth remains "challenging"[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4).
*   **Intense Competition:** The reports identify heavy competition as a downside risk, specifically citing **Apple Fitness+, Equinox/SoulCycle, BODY, Tonal, and Tempo** as key rivals[[Source 16]](#src-16)[[Source 17]](#src-17).
*   **Macroeconomic and Tariff Headwinds:** The company faces "secular & macro pressures"[[Source 3]](#src-3). Specific headwinds include tariffs, with Peloton anticipating additional reciprocal tariffs on imported tablets from Thailand and existing tariffs on aluminum content[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 15]](#src-15).
*   **Valuation Support:** There is a risk regarding "less traditional valuation support" compared to subscription peers, as there is no clear comparable company and limited visibility into near-term demand trends[[Source 18]](#src-18)[[Source 19]](#src-19).

recent price raises, PTON expects 2QFY churn to increase Y/Y & sequentially due to

subscriptuon pauses & cancellations, though FY26 churn will be flat Y/Y — implying

improved 2HFY26 churn dynamics. More broadly, PTON cited US CF industry trends

sales are factored into PTON’s FY26 Revenue guide. Following the launch of Peloton

across hardware sales & CF Subscribers, partly offset by sales growth in Precor

products. However, we believe this could prove conservative given product

innovation & likely pricing adjustments, and the FY26 Revenue guide suggests

inflection to Y/Y growth during the fiscal year. PTON plans to rationalize promos

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton Workforce Restructuring and Headcount Trends 2023–2025

Based on the **ESG Reports (including the 2025 Impact Report)** and **Proxy Statements** from FY2023 to FY2025, here is the breakdown of Peloton's workforce changes and restructuring efforts.

### **Current Employee Count**

As of **June 30, 2025**, Peloton’s global workforce consisted of **2,656 team members**[[Source 1]](#src-1).

*   **Note on Composition:** This figure includes employees of Precor, a wholly-owned subsidiary[[Source 2]](#src-2).

### **Workforce Reductions and Trends (FY2023–FY2025)**

The documentation reveals a consistent downward trend in headcount as the company executed multiple restructuring plans to right-size its operations.

_Impact Report 2025_[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2)

**Key Observation:** The decline in core Peloton staff is significant. While the FY2023 count (3,584) excluded Precor, the FY2025 count (2,656) _includes_ Precor, indicating that the reduction in legacy Peloton staff is steeper than the headline numbers suggest.

### **Specific Restructuring Actions**

The Proxy Statements and ESG reports highlight three major restructuring phases aimed at reducing fixed costs and improving cash flow.

*   **2022 Restructuring Plan:** Initiated to realign operational focus, this plan involved "getting the right people in the right roles" and stabilizing cash flow[[Source 5]](#src-5). The ESG report noted that the company provided support to team members impacted by this restructuring, including cash compensation, extended healthcare, and career support services[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **2024 Restructuring Plan:** Announced in May 2024, this plan aimed to position the company for sustained positive free cash flow. It included a **global headcount reduction of approximately 15%**, which impacted roughly **400 team members**[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, the company announced a new plan involving further "reduction in global headcount" to achieve at least **$100 million in run-rate cost savings** by the end of Fiscal 2026[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).

### **Workforce Strategy & Support**

Despite the reductions, the ESG and Proxy reports emphasize a strategy of "talent density" and support for the remaining workforce:

*   **Compensation:** The company completed pay equity studies in FY2023 and FY2025, finding no statistically significant pay gaps based on gender or race[[Source 11]](#src-11)[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Wages:** Peloton offers a starting hourly rate of no less than $19 for non-sales hourly roles in the US[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Engagement:** In FY2025, the company reported an engagement score of 77% favorable and an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 74%, an increase of 12 points from the prior year[[Source 13]](#src-13).

BUSINESS UPDATE

We entered Fiscal 2023 hard at work on the restructuring plan that we initiated in February 2022 to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, enable us to scale the business, and facilitate improved costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). At that time, we had three primary short-term goals for the business: stabilizing cash flow, getting the right people in the right roles, and returning to growth.

Our Fiscal 2023 results reflect the substantial progress that we have made re-architecting our business in pursuit of these goals. We achieved positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, excluding the costs of a one-time legal settlement, which was an important milestone in rightsizing the cost structure of our business. Our Fiscal 2023 summary results were as follows:

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). We believe that the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount by approximately 15%, which impacted roughly 400 Peloton team members; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

Our commitments Our work

Maintain 100% pay equity across gender and race/ethnicity Each year, we will conduct a global pay equity study across gender and race/ethnicity and address pay gaps.

In FY23, we commissioned a third-party consultant to conduct a global pay equity study Based on the study’s results, we adjusted base pay for a small number of team members to address gaps.2

100% of all interviewers required to undergo Hiring@Peloton training This training includes bias mitigation. Additional talent acquisition efforts include evaluating all job descriptions to reduce the risk of biased language, and leveraging consistent sourcing tools to ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates.

Engaging our people Since we know that people are more likely to perform at their best when they are engaged, we listen carefully to our team members, including through our annual global team member experience survey, The Input. This provides a consistent company-wide forum for team members to contribute their perspectives, in turn giving Peloton’s leadership visibility into team member sentiment.

In FY25, 91% of our team members completed our team member experience survey. The results demonstrated significant progress on several important metrics compared to FY24, including a rise of 12 points in our Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) to 74%.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton's Path to Financial Decline: Five Strategic Failures

Based on the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Risk Factors sections of the Annual Reports (Form 10-K) for Fiscal Years 2022 through 2024, Peloton management identified the following five primary factors as the causes of the company's financial difficulties.

### 1\. Inability to Accurately Forecast Post-Pandemic Demand

Management consistently identified the extreme difficulty in forecasting consumer behavior following the COVID-19 pandemic as a root cause of financial strain. The company scaled its operations assuming pandemic-era growth would persist, leading to significant misalignment when demand normalized.

*   **Management Quote:** "Fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business."[[Source 1]](#src-1)
*   **Management Quote:** "We have had significant difficulty in forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance."[[Source 1]](#src-1),[[Source 2]](#src-2)

### 2\. Excess Inventory and Supply Chain Commitments

Directly resulting from the forecasting challenges mentioned above, Peloton faced severe inventory gluts. The company had committed to long-term supply agreements and built up stock to meet anticipated demand that did not materialize, forcing them to write down inventory value and incur storage costs.

*   **Management Quote:** "Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand has resulted in, and may continue to result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices."[[Source 3]](#src-3)
*   **Management Quote:** "Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue... increased... primarily driven by increased inventory reserves... related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use."[[Source 4]](#src-4)

### 3\. Product Safety Issues and Recalls (Tread+ and Bike Seat Post)

Operational and financial momentum was severely impacted by safety recalls, specifically regarding the Tread+ (May 2021) and the original Bike seat post (May 2023). These recalls resulted in halted sales, expensive retrofits, returns, legal costs, and reputational damage.

*   **Management Quote:** "The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, brand reputation, and business."[[Source 5]](#src-5)
*   **Management Quote:** "We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings... related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that... could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention... and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs."[[Source 6]](#src-6)

### 4\. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Inflation

Management identified external economic pressures as a significant factor reducing consumer discretionary spending. Rising inflation increased the company's component and logistics costs while simultaneously reducing the purchasing power of their target consumers.

*   **Management Quote:** "Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect."[[Source 7]](#src-7)
*   **Management Quote:** "Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses... if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases."[[Source 8]](#src-8)

### 5\. Market Saturation and Intense Competition

As the connected fitness market matured, Peloton faced challenges regarding market saturation and intense competition from both digital apps and traditional gyms reopening. Management noted that the rapid growth phase of the industry had slowed, making customer acquisition more difficult and costly.

*   **Management Quote:** "The connected fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain."[[Source 9]](#src-9)
*   **Management Quote:** "We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps."[[Source 10]](#src-10)

Our financial profile has been characterized by strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, yields an attractive LTV for our Connected Fitness Subscriptions well in excess of our CAC. Maintaining an attractive LTV/CAC ratio is a primary goal of our customer acquisition strategy.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Update and Recent Developments As we have previously disclosed, forecasting for our business during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in its more recent stages, has proven to be very challenging. While we have been able to grow more than we anticipated just two years ago, fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business. Although our belief in the positive long-term outlook for Connected Fitness remains unchanged, the long-term cost demands of our business require us to recalibrate our near-term expectations. Additionally, while demand for our Connected Fitness Products has continued to strongly outpace pre-pandemic levels, we have had significant difficulty in _forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operating results have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.”_

Although in certain instances our agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers or partners. In addition, we may deem it necessary or advisable to renegotiate agreements with our supply partners in order to scale our inventory with demand. Disputes with our supply partners regarding our agreements could result in litigation, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs as well as disruption to our supply chain and require management’s attention. Further, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain _circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings.

### Subscription 67.7 % 62.1 %

_Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021_

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased $196.9 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased inventory reserves in the amount of $222.1 million primarily related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use as a result of our restructuring activities, costs of $169.0 million associated with Precor-branded commercial products, and increased Tread costs of $137.7 million, primarily driven by the launch of Tread in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members

_Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation._

We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties, or may arise from upgrades or changes to hardware that we or our third-party manufacturing partners may make in the ordinary course of a product’s lifecycle. Actual or perceived defects may not be identified until after a product is in market. Any defects could impact our customer experience, tarnish our brand reputation or make our products and services unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and/or personal injury. We may also become subject to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. For example, we have received reports of injuries associated with our Tread+ product, one of which led to the death of a child. As a result of the aforementioned injuries associated with these reported Tread+ incidents, in April 2021, the CPSC unilaterally issued a warning to consumers about the safety hazards associated with the Tread+. While we do not agree with all of the assertions in the CPSC’s warning, in May 2021 we initiated a voluntary recall of our Tread+ product in collaboration with the CPSC. The CPSC is currently investigating the matter and in August 2022 we were notified by the CPSC that the agency staff believes we failed to meet our statutory obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act and intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties. The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, bran...

We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that, regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations, and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, the occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations, recalls, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if Members or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products are injured. Even if injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur _expenses to defend or settle any claims or government inquiries and our brand and reputation may be harmed.

_An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and services._

Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary conditions, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit and spending power, levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions and fluctuations. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. For example, in more recent quarters, we have experienced reduced consumer demand, partially contributing to a decrease in Connected Fitness Products revenue relative to prior year periods. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

_Inflation Risk_ As a result of inflationary conditions, there have been and may continue to be additional pressures on the ongoing increases in supply chain and logistics costs, materials costs, and labor costs. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have recently experienced the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures.

_The connected fitness market is relatively new and, if the general market and specific demand for our products and services does not resume growth, or fails to grow as much as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected._

The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new and grew rapidly over the last several years, and it is uncertain whether it will resume high levels of growth and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt our products and services. We have had to educate consumers about our products and services through significant investment and provide quality content that is superior to the content and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any, and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will develop or be sustained at current levels, that the public’s interest in connected fitness and wellness will continue, or that our products and services will be widely adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.

_We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors._

Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that compete with ours.

# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton's Strategic Turnaround: From Expansion to Profitable Growth

Based on the FY2024 and FY2025 10-K filings and earnings call transcripts, Peloton’s turnaround strategy has shifted from rapid expansion to a focus on **sustainable, profitable growth** and **free cash flow**. Management executed this through three distinct restructuring plans (2022, 2024, and 2025) and specific operational initiatives designed to repair unit economics.

The following sections outline the key elements of these strategies.

### 1\. The Restructuring Plans (2022–2025)

Management implemented three major phases of restructuring to align the company's cost structure with its current revenue base.

Plan

Announcement & Focus

Key Actions & Details

Financial Goal/Impact

**2022 Restructuring Plan**

**Feb 2022**<br>Focus: Exit owned manufacturing and logistics.

*   • **Manufacturing:** Exited all owned-manufacturing operations; expanded relationship with third-party manufacturer Rexon Industrial Corp[[Source 1]](#src-1).<br>• **Real Estate:** Closed assembly plants and sold the "Peloton Output Park" facility (shell)[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).<br>• **Logistics:** Transitioned North American Field Operations to third-party logistics (3PL) providers[[Source 1]](#src-1).<br>• **Headcount:** Significant reduction in delivery workforce and member support roles[[Source 1]](#src-1).

Substantially completed by FY2025[[Source 3]](#src-3).

**2024 Restructuring Plan**

**April/May 2024**<br>Focus: Headcount and Retail Footprint.

*   • **Headcount:** Reduced global headcount by approximately 15% (impacting ~400 employees)[[Source 4]](#src-4)[[Source 5]](#src-5).<br>• **Retail:** Accelerated closures of retail showroom locations to reduce fixed costs[[Source 4]](#src-4)[[Source 6]](#src-6).

Targeted **$200 million** in annualized run-rate savings by the end of FY2025[[Source 7]](#src-7). Management reported exceeding this target[[Source 8]](#src-8).

**2025 Restructuring Plan**

**August 2025**<br>Focus: Operating Efficiency & Growth Reinvestment.

*   • **Headcount:** Further reduction in global headcount[[Source 9]](#src-9).<br>• **Cost Structure:** Continued improvement of operating efficiency to reinvest savings into differentiating capabilities[[Source 9]](#src-9).

Targeted at least **$100 million** in run-rate savings by the end of FY2026[[Source 10]](#src-10).

### 2\. Operational Turnaround Strategy

Beyond structural cost cutting, management implemented specific strategic initiatives to improve **unit economics** and **Gross Margin**.

Management moved away from "growth at all costs" to prioritizing the Lifetime Value (LTV) to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio.

*   **Pricing & Promotions:** The company reduced promotional activity, aligning discounts strictly with product margin profiles[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 11]](#src-11). In Q1 FY2025, Peloton raised prices on bike products in international markets to expand gross margins[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Secondary Market Monetization:** A "Used Equipment Activation Fee" was launched to monetize second-hand hardware owners, increasing the LTV of customers joining via the secondary market[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13).
*   **Gross Margin Recovery:** By Q2 FY2025, Connected Fitness Product gross margin returned to double digits (12.9%) for the first time in over three years due to a favorable mix of premium products and pricing discipline[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 14]](#src-14).

Peloton shifted its distribution strategy to lower fixed costs and meet customers where they shop.

*   **Retail Evolution:** The company continued closing underperforming first-party retail stores while testing cost-efficient "micro-store" concepts (e.g., Nashville)[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
*   **Third-Party Retail:** Aggressive expansion into third-party channels, including a seasonal partnership with **Costco** (selling Bike+) and distribution via **Amazon** and **FitShop** in Germany[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
*   **Commercial Business:** Peloton created a unified commercial business unit combining Peloton and **Precor** to target hospitality and gym markets, including a partnership with **Hyatt Hotels**[[Source 17]](#src-17)[[Source 18]](#src-18).

To drive retention and engagement (LTV), management invested in software and hardware innovations.

*   **Hardware Refresh:** Launched the **Cross Training Series** and **Peloton Pro Series** (commercial grade) in October 2025[[Source 19]](#src-19).
*   **New Software/Apps:**
    *   **Strength+ App:** A gym-focused app launched in December 2024 to target strength training users[[Source 20]](#src-20)[[Source 21]](#src-21).
    *   **Personalized Plans:** AI/ML-driven workout plans tailored to user goals[[Source 22]](#src-22).
    *   **Teams:** A social feature allowing members to share workouts and compete, launched in September 2024[[Source 23]](#src-23).

In fiscal year 2023, we continued to take actions to implement the 2022 Restructuring Plan. In July 2022, we announced we were exiting all owned-manufacturing operations and expanding our relationship with a Taiwanese manufacturer, Rexon Industrial Corporation. Additionally, in August 2022, we announced our decision to (i) fully transition our North American Field Operations to third-party providers, including the significant reduction of our delivery workforce teams; (ii) eliminate a significant number of roles on the North America Member Support team and exit our real-estate footprints in our Plano and Tempe locations; and (iii) reduce our retail showroom presence. In January 2024, we completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million.

_Restructuring_ In February 2022, we announced and began implementing the 2022 Restructuring Plan to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, scale the business, and improve costs. The 2022 Restructuring Plan originally included: (i) reducing our headcount; (ii) closing several assembly and manufacturing plants, including the completion and subsequent sale of the shell facility for our previously planned Peloton Output Park; (iii) closing and consolidating several distribution facilities; and (iv) shifting to third-party logistics providers in certain locations.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). The 2024 Restructuring Plan will position us for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling us to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

Upon full implementation, we expect the plan to result in reduced annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of its fiscal year 2025. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair our ability to conduct any of our key business functions. However, we may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the 2022 Restructuring Plan and the 2024 Restructuring Plan, and costs may be greater than _expected.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

Progress on cost reduction efforts are reflected in our profitability metrics. We are proud to report Q1 results, which include $13 million of GAAP operating income, $11 million of free cash flow, and $116 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our results also highlight the continued strength of our category-leading connected fitness subscription business, which has over 6 million loyal members, 2.9 million connected fitness subscribers, 586,000 app subscribers and over $1.7 billion of annualized subscription revenue was 68% gross margin. I am thrilled to see our cost reduction efforts materialize in our financial performance to date.

And I must say the team has done an incredible job not only to deliver but to exceed our goals thus far in reducing costs. A key part of managing our business toward profitable growth involves ensuring all the subscribers we acquire are profitable and ensuring we have sustainable unit economics. We manage our business through a lens of LTV to CAC and have taken actions to improve the areas that are in our immediate control on both the LTV and the CAC side of the equation. To enhance customer LTV, we are focused on expanding connected fitness products' gross margin across all of our products, sales channels, and markets, leading us to make certain pricing changes and reduce promotional activity in Q1.

We also launched the used equipment activation fee, which increases the LTV for new customers who joined Peloton via the secondary market. Chris will talk in more detail about what we're doing to reduce our customer acquisition costs as well. Some of the pricing changes I mentioned were specific to our international business, where we raised the price for all of our bike products in all international markets in the first quarter to expand connected fitness product gross margin.

Furthermore, we have offered and may in the future offer, new subscription products, implement promotions, or replace or modify current subscription models and pricing, any of which could result in additional costs or could adversely impact Subscriber retention. For example, we offer Peloton Rental in select markets, and we have launched a Used Equipment Activation Fee applicable to Connected Fitness Products purchased in the secondary market. In the future, we may introduce shipping and return fees, or tariff surcharges. It is unknown how our Subscribers will react to new models and whether the costs or logistics of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the adoption of new revenue models adversely impacts our Subscriber relationships, Subscriber growth, Subscriber engagement, and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.

This was especially important in Germany, where we transitioned our operations to an entirely third-party retail and distribution model. This means that while our first-party website will remain live to serve as a brand awareness and product education platform, we are now directing traffic to third-party retailers, namely Amazon and FitShop for sales and fulfillment. Germany sales have outperformed our internal expectations following the third-party transition. We are optimistic that this channel strategy could provide a more capital-efficient model to explore expansion into additional international markets over time.

Paid connected fitness subscribers in our international markets grew 8% in Q1. We remain bullish on international as a source for long-term growth based on the strong retention and engagement trends that mirror those in our North America business. We continue to optimize our sales channel strategy for stronger unit economics in our North American business as well. In Q1, we continued our efforts to close underperforming first-party retail stores.

Next month, we will test the reimagined smaller store concept in Nashville, Tennessee to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model. We also expanded third-party and online retail capabilities ahead of the all-important holiday season. On our website, we launched an exciting partnership with Truemed in early October, which makes it easier for qualified U.S.-based customers to use pre-tax, HSA or FSA dollars to purchase Peloton products. We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, the Peloton Bike Plus will be available at Costco this holiday season with special pricing across 300 U.S.

First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Update and Recent Developments

Connected Fitness Sales Channels We continue to optimize our sales and distribution channels. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued our retail store closure efforts, and next month we plan to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model by testing a reimagined smaller store concept. Ahead of the holiday season, we are expanding our third party retail channels as well. The Peloton Bike+ will be available at Costco with special pricing for Costco members across 300 US locations and Costco's website for a limited time. We also shifted our German retail and distribution model to Amazon and FitShop, allowing us to operate in a capital efficient way that we believe may serve as a model for future International expansion.

Peter Stern CEO, President & Director

Bill, I love your leaderboard name. Strategically, our commercial business unit is set up to win. First, the market opportunity is large, and we still have very low share. And when I talk to gym operators, they all tell me that there's only one brand that consumers ask for by name, and that's Peloton. Second, the combination of Precor and Peloton just makes sense. You think about Precor's brawn coming together with Peloton's brains, and you've got something no one else can match. And let me explain what I mean by that because we've got plenty of smart people over on the Precor team. Precor builds equipment that is truly commercial grade. It's the kind of stuff that's built to be run like 12 hours a day. And they also have the installation and service capabilities for commercial establishments. Peloton has software, content, community that's absolutely unmatched. You bring those things together, and we've got every reason to be able to win.

Access to the Strength+ App is available with an All Access, Guide, or App+ Membership or through a standalone Strength+ subscription.

We are additionally focused on growing our Paid App subscribers, including through efforts such as our branding and App relaunch in May 2023 and launch of the Strength+ App in December 2024. We define a “Connected Fitness Subscription” as a person, household, or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building, who has paid for a subscription to a Connected Fitness Product (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers).

Meeting Members in More Places Meeting Members in more places is another way to improve our service and grow our business. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app designed for gym-based strength workouts with audio guidance from expert coaches, as well as a custom strength workout generator. It reached over 220,000 monthly active users in the three months ended December 31, 2024, the vast majority of whom were existing All-Access Members, and represents another value-add for our Members.

We see an opportunity to be a more holistic wellness provider by offering solutions to our Members that address strength, mental well-being, sleep & recovery, and more. The mix of Member engagement in these categories is increasing, so we’re responding by creating even more experiences to serve these needs. Additionally, with so many classes to choose from, we want to help our Members reach their goals more easily by recommending the best workouts for them. In January, we launched Personalized Plans, which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable Members to create workout plans tailored to their goals and preferences. Nearly half a million Members started a Personalized Plan in the three months ended March 31, 2025, and we’re pleased with the repeat engagement from Members using them.

greater capital efficiency and improved unit economics.

Deepening Connections Among Our Members As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance, thereby going further, faster. And research shows that people achieve better fitness outcomes when they work out together. So we’re focused on deepening connections among our more than 6.0 million Members, both with Peloton and with our supportive community. In September, we launched Teams, which enables Members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch, and Members who join them are more likely to work out. In the three months ended December 31, 2024, we hosted the 11th annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burn where over 50,000 Members worked out together live. This year’s Turkey Burn also brought "The Feast," our first Thanksgiving live Strength class and the largest live Strength class in Peloton’s history.

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

# <a id="src-main"></a> The Peter Stern Era: Peloton’s Strategic Evolution 2025

Based on the earnings transcripts, 8-K filings, and proxy statements from January 2025 through November 2025, Peter Stern’s strategic vision centers on evolving Peloton from a connected fitness company into a broader "fitness and wellness" ecosystem. His stated purpose for the company is to "**empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy**"[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).

To achieve this, Stern defined a "magic formula" comprising premium equipment, AI-powered software, world-class instructors, and a supportive community[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4). Since taking over as CEO on January 1, 2025, he has implemented changes across four primary strategic pillars:

### 1\. Improve Member Outcomes through Innovation

Stern’s strategy prioritizes holistic health outcomes over simple hardware sales, expanding into strength, mental wellness, and recovery.

*   **AI and Personalization (Peloton IQ):** Stern launched **Peloton IQ** in October 2025, an AI-powered personalized coach that uses data from wearables and class history to provide individual guidance and recommendations[[Source 5]](#src-5)[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **Hardware Overhaul (Cross Training Series):** In October 2025, Peloton released the **Cross Training Series** (Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row+). These devices feature swivel screens for floor workouts and, in the "Plus" line, advanced computer vision to count reps and correct form[[Source 3]](#src-3)\> <[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **Expansion into Wellness:**
    *   **Mental Fitness:** In September 2025, Peloton acquired **Breathwrk**, a subscription app for breathing exercises, integrating it into Peloton memberships[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).
    *   **Medical Partnerships:** Stern announced collaborations with the **Hospital for Special Surgery** for injury prevention content and **Respin Health** to study and support menopause[[Source 11]](#src-11).
*   **Software Apps:** Stern oversaw the scaling of the **Strength+ App** (launched December 2024), designed for gym-based strength training[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13). Conversely, the company **discontinued the sale of the Peloton Guide** hardware in July 2025, shifting focus to software-based tracking[[Source 8]](#src-8).

### 2\. Meet Members Everywhere (Expansion of Distribution)

Stern shifted the company’s distribution strategy to meet customers in physical retail spaces and commercial settings.

*   **Commercial Push (Pro Series):** He established a unified commercial business unit combining Peloton and Precor. This included launching the **Peloton Pro Series** (commercial-grade Bike+, Tread+, and Row+) for hotels and multi-family residences[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 14]](#src-14).
*   **Retail Partnerships & Footprint:**
    *   **Micro-Stores:** Expanded from one to ten "micro-stores" in the U.S. by late 2025 to provide capital-efficient physical touchpoints[[Source 15]](#src-15).
    *   **Third-Party Retail:** Entered a partnership with **Johnson Fitness & Wellness** to place products in 100 retail locations and utilized **Costco** as a seasonal partner[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
    *   **Precor Integration:** Leveraged Precor’s infrastructure to handle installation and service for commercial clients[[Source 17]](#src-17).

### 3\. Make Members for Life (Deepening Connection)

To increase retention and lifetime value (LTV), Stern introduced gamification and loyalty mechanics.

*   **Club Peloton:** Launched a loyalty and recognition program in late 2025, where members unlock exclusive content and rewards based on engagement[[Source 18]](#src-18).
*   **Teams:** Introduced official instructor-led "Teams" (e.g., "Move for Life," "HYROX") to foster social connections and competition among members[[Source 16]](#src-16)[[Source 18]](#src-18).

### 4\. Operational Discipline and Financial Efficiency

Stern continued the restructuring efforts begun by his predecessors to ensure sustainable cash flow.

*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, Stern announced a new restructuring plan involving global headcount reductions to target at least **$100 million in run-rate savings** by the end of FY2026[[Source 19]](#src-19)[[Source 20]](#src-20).
*   **Pricing Adjustments:** He implemented monetization initiatives, including expert assembly fees and subscription price changes in late 2025, accepting a temporary increase in churn to improve long-term unit economics[[Source 21]](#src-21)[[Source 22]](#src-22).
*   **Executive Compensation Redesign:** For FY2026, the compensation structure for leadership was redesigned to heavily weight performance-based stock units (PSUs) and reduce cash salaries, aligning executive pay more aggressively with shareholder value and free cash flow targets[[Source 23]](#src-23)[[Source 24]](#src-24).

The Peloton team has made impressive progress over the last few quarters in putting the company on sound financial footing. Nonetheless, we have a tall hill to climb before we can demonstrate the impact of that virtuous cycle on member and revenue growth. So right now, our primary focus is on executing against and delivering our fiscal '25 financial and operating goals while we prepare to climb that tall hill in fiscal '26 and beyond. We'll share more about longer-term strategy as the calendar year progresses.

But today, I can share my perspective after one month of official duties at Peloton. Achieving the new purpose we've defined for ourselves empowering people to live fit, strong, long, and happy means we need to focus on innovation on new products and experiences that lead to even better outcomes for members, presence in more places, so we can meet members wherever they are. More ways to connect members with Peloton and our uniquely supportive community. And last but certainly not least, improved unit economics and the cost structure that's rightsized for our business.

Overview

Peloton is a leading global fitness and wellness company that empowers its Members to live fit, strong, long, and happy by providing fitness and wellness products and services they can use anytime, anywhere. We have a highly engaged community of nearly 6 million Members as of September 30, 2025, across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Austria. As a category innovator at the nexus of fitness and wellness, technology, and media, we deliver experiences through our world-renowned Instructors, premium hardware and innovative software, personalization, and extensive modalities and content formats. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, Peloton aims to scale across the markets in which it operates.

Throughout the quarter, the Peloton team was hard at work, setting the stage for our new chapter by innovating on every aspect of our magic formula of premium equipment, software powered by AI, world-class instructors and a deeply engaged community. In last quarter's remarks, I laid out Peloton's strategy. The first and most foundational part of that strategy is our commitment to improving member outcomes. To that end, on October 1, we simultaneously unveiled and began shipping the most significant product update in our history with an all-new equipment lineup, the Peloton Cross Training Series and the Peloton Pro series.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

Before we open for Q&A, I'd like to hand it back to Peter to talk about what makes Peloton so special and gives us such optimism for the future.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Liz. You and the team should be proud of the work you all accomplished in Q2. There are lots of companies that make fitness equipment, dozens of fitness apps, countless trainers, but there is only one Peloton. That's because we combine the best hardware, the best software, and the best human coaches with the world's most supportive community.

We've made several additional upgrades, including improvements in audio across the board and featuring sound by Sonos in our Plus line for a studio-like experience. On October 1, we also launched Peloton IQ, which gives every Peloton member a personalized coach regardless of whether they own our new Cross Training Series, our Original Series or work out with a Peloton app subscription. Peloton IQ uses AI to turn years of insights and data points, including your goals, class activity and health stats from wearable devices into personal training guidance. In so doing, Peloton IQ makes some of the benefits of personal training accessible to millions of people, providing individual insights and recommendations based on members' intentions, preferences, level of fitness and performance.

So let me start with the usage point. It's actually been really -- that's been really positive. So we mentioned earlier that we've had 500,000 of our members use Club Peloton already. We're also seeing more people taking workouts from our home screen, and let me explain why that matters. For a lot of our members, they kind of stay with the same old, same old. They go to the classes page, and go to their comfort zone. But when people are taking workouts from the home screen, it means that the recommendations that we're delivering with Peloton IQ are starting to hit home.

Our understanding of human health has progressed since Peloton took the world by storm with the introduction of the original bike. And today, we know that adults need to pursue a combination of cardio, strength and more to achieve their wellness goals. To that end, all Peloton products now feature advanced swivel screens, allowing members to easily transition between cardio and strength to complete floor workouts, including strength, yoga, Pilates and stretching. Our new Plus line includes an advanced computer vision movement tracking camera that counts your reps, corrects your form and offers weight suggestions in real time, along with voice control, enabling members to adjust weights, skip moves or pause their workout without touching a thing.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s Connected Fitness Products portfolio included the Original Series Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row, Guide (discontinued as of July 2025), and various Precor products. In October 2025, the Company launched a refreshed portfolio of Connected Fitness Products called the Cross Training Series, including the Cross Training Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row+. The Company continues to sell the refurbished Original Series Peloton Bike and Bike+. Additionally, the Company launched the Peloton Pro Series, a refresh of its portfolio of commercial-certified Peloton-branded products, which now include the Bike+ Pro, Tread+ Pro, and Row+ Pro.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

We define a “Member” as any individual who has a Peloton account through a Paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a Paid App Subscription, inclusive of the Peloton App+, App One, Strength+, and Breathwrk Memberships (our “Peloton Apps”), and engages in one or more workouts in the trailing 12-month period. We define workout engagement as either (i) completing the lesser of 50% or 10 minutes of Instructor-led classes, Scenic, and Lanebreak workouts; (ii) at least 10 minutes of any activity tracking workout (such as “Just Ride”, “Just Run”, or “Just Row”) or Entertainment workout; (iii) at least 5 minutes of any Strength+ workout with 80% of sets marked complete; or (iv) completing a Breathwrk class.

We also announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the Hospital for Special Surgery, the world leader in orthopedics to offer Peloton members access to expert care for joint and muscle pain, injuries and orthopedic conditions. We've co-developed class collections with HSS medical experts, recently launching the first 5 on preventing some of the most common types of injuries. We're also committed to meeting members where they are in their life stages. In response to member demand, we started with menopause, a life stage that impacts the majority of our members at some point in their lives. We're extremely proud of our partnership with Respin Health, founded by Halle Berry to revolutionize menopause care with an integrated holistic approach, and have just launched a study with over 1,000 women to measure the benefits of targeted movement strategies and other evidence-based lifestyle interventions. These findings will power our evolving evidence-based exercise programming and menopause support.

On the cardio side, we continue to elevate Tread, thanks to our marketing efforts, which enabled us to exceed our Tread portfolio sales goals and achieve higher new subscription attach rates on Tread and Tread+ sales year over year in Q2. And with the release of our 10K training program in Q2, Peloton now offers training for all major race distances. And already over 300,000 members have trained for a running race with Peloton. We're also seeing the positive impact of innovative new software features like Pace Targets, which offer running instruction with personalized intensity levels rather than treadmill speed.

Nearly 60% of our members who take instructor-led running workouts on our Tread products are using Pace Targets, and our members running paces are improving as a result. Another way to improve our business is to meet members in more places. For example, at the gym. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app offering non-class strength training programs with audio guidance from expert coaches and a custom workout generator.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

Our commercial business unit continues to show strong performance and is an area in which we are also innovating. The new Peloton Pro series offers a complete lineup of Peloton equipment for commercial environments such as hotel gyms and multi-residential buildings, and includes the Tread+ Pro, Peloton's first ever commercial treadmill. And Precor launched its new commercial Tread, the Breakaway. This new slat belt treadmill includes a sled-style push mode, cadence coach and a new console design. Peloton also recently became the primary fitness partner powering Utah City, a 700-acre mixed-use development outside of Salt Lake City. And now every residential building in Utah City will feature a Peloton space that includes several pieces of Peloton equipment and accessories for residents.

The second part of our strategy is to meet members everywhere. We have made great progress on this front over the past few weeks. We now have 10 micro stores in the U.S., up from 1 prior to Q1. And we also announced a new retail partnership with Johnson Fitness & Wellness, the nation's largest independent fitness retailer with 100 locations across the U.S. We now have a physical retail presence in 46 states, while in Australia, we launched a retail presence in 11 franchise locations throughout the country. Our expanded retail footprint positions us well for the holiday season, providing opportunities for consumers to test and experience our new innovations.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

drove more Bike+ unit sales than any other third-party retail partner, enabling us to meet many new members at a retailer they trust. And we remain focused on meeting more new members across the globe. We are encouraged by the performance of international hardware sales in Q2 alongside our continued growth in Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions from international markets. Turning to the connections between Peloton's members with the company and with each other.

As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance. So we are focused on deepening the connections our 6 million members have with each other and with Peloton. In September, we launched Teams, which enables members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch.

# <a id="src-17"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 17)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Bill, you talked also about a third point I'd raise, which is international. Peloton is only in 6 countries right now, but Precor is in over 60 countries. So that opens up opportunities for Peloton to enter these new markets in ways that build on existing distribution and relationships that we've already got, starting with B2B. So strategically, we're in a great place. It's just an execution challenge from here, and you can already see us executing on this. For example, Precor now provides all the installation and service for Peloton commercial locations, including hotels. Last month, we announced Precor's first slated tread, the Breakaway with a new smarter, more powerful screen and Peloton's first-ever commercial tread initially for hospitality and for multi-dwelling units was launched as part of the new Peloton Pro line. So you add all of this up, I feel great about where we are with our commercial business unit, and I'm confident we're going to be able to bring this together and deliver an industry-leading set of products and solutions on behalf of commercial clients.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

The third part of our strategy is to make members for life. Celebrating achievement is crucial for sticking with any program. So last month, we launched Club Peloton, our first loyalty and recognition program. As members engage with our platform, they progress through levels from bronze to legend, unlocking exclusive content recognition and rewards. Already more than 500,000 members have engaged with Club Peloton. On October 1, we also introduced official Peloton teams led by Peloton instructors, including Move for Life, Menopause, HYROX and Cross Training. These teams provide a forum for members to connect, discuss goals and learn from each other and from experts, further elevating Peloton's community. Since October 1, engagement with teams is up nearly 50%.

4\. Restructuring

In February 2022, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring plan (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in April 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded and collectively with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”).

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to continue to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. Our actions under our previous restructuring plans announced in February 2022 (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in May 2024 (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan. The 2022, 2024, and 2025 plans, taken together, are referred to as the “Restructuring Plans.” The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

Ultimately, all these strategic initiatives, product innovation, wellness expansion and new distribution are underpinned by the fourth part of our strategy, our commitment to operational discipline and business excellence. Our full year guidance announced in August included targeted initiatives to improve monetization, such as the introduction of expert assembly fees. These were implemented within the quarter and exceeded our expectations. At the same time, our cost reduction plans remain on track. Perhaps most important, we remain confident in our ability to inflect toward revenue growth as the fiscal year progresses, building on the actions we took in Q1 and on October 1. We continue to monitor and respond to evolving tariff policies and broader changes in the macro environment and consumer spending. While those external factors are real, our focus remains on execution and being the best fitness and wellness partner to our members.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

### REDESIGN OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR FISCAL 2026

OVERVIEW In September 2025, the Compensation Committee approved a comprehensive redesign of our executive compensation program for Fiscal 2026. The Compensation Committee believes the redesign will strengthen our commitment to our pay for performance philosophy and will further align certain key components of the program with prevailing market practice among our compensation peer group. The redesign is applicable to our named executive officers and our leadership team members more broadly, other than Mr. Stern and certain leadership team members who joined the Company in Fiscal 2025, who already have compensation arrangements in place that are designed in accordance with the new compensation philosophy.

# SLIDE 1: From Crisis to Cash Flow — The Turnaround Story

## **Key Message**
Peloton has successfully completed a strategic pivot from a hardware-centric, vertically integrated business model to an asset-light, subscription-focused operation — transforming from burning $2.4B in cash (FY22) to generating $324M in free cash flow (FY25). The structural flaw has been addressed; the question is now whether this smaller, leaner company can return to growth.

---

### Supporting Points

**1. The Scale of the Collapse**
| Metric | FY21 Peak | FY25 | Change |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $4.02B | $2.49B | **-38%** |
| Hardware Revenue | $3.15B | $817M | **-74%** |
| Subscription Revenue | $872M | $1.67B | **+92%** |
| Adjusted EBITDA | +$254M | +$404M | +59%* |
| Free Cash Flow | -$492M | +$324M | **+$816M swing** |

*Note: FY22 EBITDA was -$983M, making the true recovery a $1.4B improvement

**2. The Root Cause Was Structural, Not Just Cyclical**
Management identified five causal factors, but the underlying structural flaw was Peloton's vertically integrated operating model (owned manufacturing, owned logistics, owned retail) which created massive fixed costs that couldn't flex when post-pandemic demand collapsed.

| What Broke | Impact | Restructuring Response |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Owned manufacturing | Overcapacity, inventory write-downs | Exited ALL owned manufacturing; partnered with Rexon |
| Owned logistics | High fixed costs, regional complexity | Shifted to 3PL nationwide |
| 135 retail showrooms | Unsustainable lease obligations | Closed most; pivoted to 10 micro-stores + third-party retail |
| Overstaffed organization | $983M negative EBITDA (FY22) | Reduced headcount from peak to 2,656 (-26% since FY23) |

**3. Revenue Mix Transformation**
The business model has fundamentally shifted:
- FY21: Hardware = 78% of revenue, Subscriptions = 22%
- FY25: Hardware = 33% of revenue, Subscriptions = **67%**

This is not shrinkage—it's transformation. Subscription gross margins (~69%) are 5x hardware margins (~13.6%), meaning profitability improved even as revenue declined.

**4. Cash Position Stabilized**
- FY22: Consumed $2.36B in cash (negative FCF + restructuring charges)
- FY25: Generated $324M in free cash flow
- $722M unrestricted cash on hand
- On track to pay down ~$200M convertible notes (Feb 2026)

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Two-panel chart:**
- **Left panel**: Stacked bar chart showing revenue composition shift (FY21 → FY25) with hardware declining and subscriptions growing as proportion
- **Right panel**: Waterfall chart showing the free cash flow bridge from -$2.36B (FY22) to +$324M (FY25), with restructuring savings and margin improvement as the key drivers

---

### Actionable Insight

> **The restructuring addressed the root cause (fixed-cost vertical integration) rather than just treating symptoms.** However, this was a *survival* strategy, not a *growth* strategy. The company is now right-sized for a ~2.8M subscriber base generating ~$2.5B in revenue. 
>
> **Board Action Required**: Define the strategic intent — is Peloton a "harvest" business (maximize cash flow from existing base) or a "growth" business (reinvest to expand)? Current trajectory supports the former; Peter Stern's initiatives signal ambition for the latter. These require different capital allocation frameworks and management incentives.

---

### Speaker Notes

Peloton's crisis was fundamentally different from a typical demand shock. When pandemic tailwinds reversed in late 2021, the company discovered that its vertically integrated model — which had been a competitive advantage during hyper-growth — had become an existential threat. Unlike competitors who outsourced manufacturing and logistics, Peloton owned factories, warehouses, delivery fleets, and 135 retail showrooms. When revenue fell 38% from peak, these fixed costs couldn't flex, resulting in nearly $3 billion in losses over FY22-FY23.

The restructuring response was appropriately aggressive. By exiting all owned manufacturing (partnering with Rexon), shifting to third-party logistics, and closing most retail showrooms, management converted the cost structure from predominantly fixed to predominantly variable. This structural change is permanent and positions the company to remain profitable even if the subscriber base continues to erode modestly.

However, the board should recognize that this turnaround was achieved through contraction, not innovation. The company is significantly smaller than at its peak, and the current profitability depends on maintaining the existing subscriber base rather than growing it. The question facing the board is whether this is the steady state, or whether the new management team can reignite growth from this stabilized foundation.

# SLIDE 2: Execution Scorecard — Management Credibility Assessment

## **Key Message**
Management has established a consistent track record of beating guidance and raising targets over the past five quarters, earning credibility on operational execution. Cost discipline is a GREEN light; subscriber growth is RED. The board should trust near-term profitability guidance but apply skepticism to any growth projections until proven.

---

### Targets vs. Actuals: The Pattern of Beats

**FY25 Guidance Evolution (Quarterly)**
| Quarter | Initial Target | Final Result | Performance |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| FY25 EBITDA | $200-250M (Aug 2024) | **$404M** | Beat high end by **$154M** |
| FY25 FCF | $75M (Aug 2024) → $200M (Feb 2025) | **$324M** | Beat revised target by **62%** |
| FY25 Gross Margin | 47% (Aug 2024) | **50.9%** | Beat by **390 bps** |
| FY25 Revenue | $2.43-2.48B | **$2.49B** | Within range |
| FY25 Subscribers | 2.68-2.75M → 2.75-2.79M | **2.80M** | Beat revised target |

**Q1 FY26 Performance vs. Guidance (Nov 2025)**
| Metric | Guidance | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $540-545M | **$551M** | Beat by $6M |
| Subscribers | 2.71-2.73M | **2.732M** | Beat by 2K |
| Adj. EBITDA | $90-100M | **$118M** | Beat by **$18M** |
| Free Cash Flow | Slightly negative | **+$67M** | Massive beat |
| Gross Margin | 52% | 51.5% | **Miss** (-50bps)* |

*Miss attributable to $13.5M one-time Bike+ seat post charge; underlying margin was 54%

### RAG Status Assessment

| Strategic Initiative | Status | Evidence |

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators (What to Watch Next)**
| Indicator | Current Signal | Implication |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Member engagement | Up **50%** since Oct 1 | Retention should improve |
| Club Peloton participation | **500K+ members** engaged | Loyalty program gaining traction |
| Member support satisfaction | 3.1 → **4.3** (Q2 FY24 → Q2 FY25) | Service quality improving |
| Hardware gross margin | Back to **double digits** (12.9%) | Unit economics healthy |

**Lagging Indicators (Current Pain Points)**
| Indicator | Current Signal | Implication |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Subscriber count | **2.73M** and declining | Base erosion continues |
| Gross additions | Declining YoY | Acquisition engine not working |
| Hardware revenue | **-18% YoY** (FY25) | New customer entry point shrinking |

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Dashboard-style scorecard with three components:**
1. **Top**: Line chart showing guidance vs. actual for EBITDA/FCF over 5 quarters (pattern of consistent beats)
2. **Middle**: RAG status tiles for each strategic initiative
3. **Bottom**: Two-column comparison of leading indicators (trending positive) vs. lagging indicators (trending negative)

---

### Actionable Insight

> **Management has earned credibility on operational execution but has not yet demonstrated ability to drive growth.** The consistent pattern of "beat and raise" on profitability metrics suggests conservative guidance methodology — the board can trust near-term financial targets.
>
> **However, the RED status on acquisition and growth should trigger heightened scrutiny.** When Peter Stern presents in Q2 FY26 (Feb 2026), demand specific KPIs:
> - What is the target LTV/CAC ratio? (Currently undisclosed; long-term target is 2-3x)
> - What gross additions level is required to stabilize subscriber base?
> - What is the expected payback period on new hardware customers?
>
> **Board Monitoring Recommendation**: Establish a "subscriber floor threshold" — the minimum subscriber count that maintains business viability. Current trajectory suggests ~2.6M by end FY26. If subscriber count approaches 2.5M, trigger a strategic review.

---

### Speaker Notes

The execution scorecard tells a clear story: management can cut costs and improve margins, but hasn't yet proven they can grow the business. Over five consecutive quarters, the team has beaten guidance on profitability metrics, often by substantial margins. The Q1 FY26 result was particularly notable — free cash flow came in at $67 million versus an expectation of slightly negative, a swing of roughly $75-80 million. This wasn't luck; it reflects structural improvements in the cost base and working capital management.

However, the subscriber trajectory should concern the board. The base has declined from a peak of ~3.0 million in FY23 to 2.73 million today, and management is guiding to 2.64-2.67 million by end of Q2 FY26. The pricing changes announced in October 2025 are causing a temporary spike in churn, which management expects to normalize — but the underlying trend of declining gross additions remains unaddressed.

The leading indicators from Peter Stern's initiatives — engagement up 50%, Club Peloton adoption, improved satisfaction scores — are genuinely encouraging. But these are quality metrics, not quantity metrics. The key question for the February earnings call is whether these improvements can translate into acquisition growth, or whether Peloton is simply getting better at retaining a shrinking base.

# SLIDE 3: Strategic Outlook — What Should the Board Do Next?

## **Key Message**
Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent bet on extending member lifetime value and diversifying revenue streams beyond hardware sales. Early execution signals are positive, but the strategy carries material risks. The board should monitor three specific metrics as "trip wires" that would trigger strategy reassessment.

---

### Peter Stern's Strategic Framework (Since Jan 2025)

**Company Purpose**: "Empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy"

**The "Magic Formula"**: Premium equipment + AI software + world-class instructors + supportive community

| Strategic Pillar | Key Initiatives | Status | Early Indicators |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| **1. Improve Member Outcomes** | Peloton IQ (AI coach), Cross Training Series, Breathwrk acquisition, medical partnerships | Launched Oct 2025 | Engagement up 50% |
| **2. Meet Members Everywhere** | Peloton Pro Series (commercial), micro-stores (1→10), Johnson Fitness (100 locations), Precor integration | In progress | Precor in 60+ countries vs. Peloton in 6 |
| **3. Make Members for Life** | Club Peloton (loyalty), Teams (instructor-led communities) | Launched Oct 2025 | 500K+ engaged in Club Peloton |
| **4. Operational Discipline** | 2025 restructuring ($100M savings), exec comp redesign (70% RSUs/30% PSUs) | On track | FY26 FCF target raised to $250M+ |

---

### Key Opportunities (Probability-Weighted Assessment)

| Opportunity | Probability | Impact | Time Horizon | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Content licensing expansion** | Medium-High | High | FY26-27 | Lululemon deal, Hyatt partnership established; model proven |
| **B2B/Commercial via Precor** | Medium | High | FY26-28 | Unified commercial unit created; Precor provides global infrastructure |
| **International expansion** | Low-Medium | High | FY27+ | Currently 6 markets; Precor in 60+ but integration complex |
| **LTV extension through engagement** | Medium-High | Medium | FY26-27 | Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Teams showing early traction |
| **Hardware margin improvement to 20%** | Medium | Medium | FY27+ | Long-term target; currently at 13.6%, improving |

---

### Key Risks (With Mitigation Assessment)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Quality |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Subscriber base erosion** | High | Critical | 🟡 Weak — initiatives focused on retention, not acquisition |
| **Tariff exposure** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — diversified supply chain; $45M impact absorbed in FY26 guidance |
| **Pricing elasticity** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 Moderate — Oct 2025 increases causing temporary churn spike; watching closely |
| **Market saturation** | High | High | 🟡 Weak — connected fitness TAM uncertain; Peloton strategy assumes premium segment defensible |
| **Execution complexity** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — Peter Stern has simplified strategy to four pillars; comp aligned |

---

### FY26 Guidance (Updated Nov 2025)

| Metric | FY26 Guidance | Change vs. FY25 |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Total Revenue | $2.4-2.5B | -2% at midpoint |
| Adj. EBITDA | $425-475M | +12% at midpoint |
| Free Cash Flow | ≥$250M | -23% but from exceptionally strong FY25 |
| Gross Margin | 52% | +110 bps |
| Net Churn | Flat YoY | Stabilization target |
| Operating Income | **Positive (full year)** | First time in company history |

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Risk-opportunity matrix** with probability on Y-axis and impact on X-axis:
- Upper right quadrant (high probability, high impact): Subscriber erosion, market saturation
- Upper left (low probability, high impact): International expansion
- Lower right (high probability, medium impact): LTV extension, content licensing
- Include management's mitigation quality as color coding

---

### Actionable Insight: Three Board-Level Recommendations

#### **Recommendation 1: Monitor Content Licensing Revenue as Leading Indicator**
Content licensing (Lululemon, Hyatt, etc.) represents Peloton's ability to monetize its content platform beyond hardware sales — the core premise of the strategic pivot. This metric is not currently broken out separately in financials.

> **Board Action**: Request quarterly reporting on content licensing revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue. Establish a target (e.g., 10% by FY27) and flag any quarters where it declines.

---

#### **Recommendation 2: Establish Subscriber Floor Threshold**
The current profitability model depends on maintaining a subscriber base large enough to cover fixed costs. Management has not disclosed the minimum viable subscriber count.

> **Board Action**: Work with management to define a "subscriber floor" — the threshold below which the cost structure would need further adjustment. Estimate: ~2.3-2.5M subscribers. If projected trajectory approaches this floor, trigger formal strategic review.

---

#### **Recommendation 3: Demand Concrete Growth Metrics by Q2 FY26**
Peter Stern has articulated a compelling vision but has not provided quantified growth targets. The board should not accept another quarter of "inflection toward growth" language without supporting metrics.

> **Board Action**: In the February 2026 earnings review, require management to present:
> - Target gross additions by channel (direct, third-party retail, commercial)
> - Expected customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel
> - LTV/CAC ratio targets by customer segment
> - Timeline for revenue growth inflection (specific quarter, not "sometime in FY26")

---

### What Success Looks Like (12-Month Scorecard)

| Metric | RED Trigger | AMBER Watch | GREEN Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Ending Subscribers (Jun 2026) | <2.5M | 2.5-2.7M | >2.7M |
| Content Licensing as % Sub Revenue | <3% | 3-5% | >5% |
| Gross Additions (FY26) | Down >15% YoY | Down 5-15% | Flat or positive |
| Free Cash Flow | <$200M | $200-250M | >$250M |
| Churn (Full Year) | >1.8% | 1.6-1.8% | ≤1.6% |

---

### Speaker Notes

The strategic question facing Peloton is whether it can transition from a "stabilized decline" trajectory to a "sustainable growth" trajectory. Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent approach to this challenge: extend the lifetime value of existing members through AI personalization and loyalty programs, while diversifying distribution through commercial/B2B channels and content licensing partnerships.

The early indicators are genuinely positive. Engagement is up 50% since October, Club Peloton has attracted over 500,000 participants, and member satisfaction scores have improved dramatically. The new Cross Training Series hardware has received positive reviews. These are the foundations for retention improvement.

However, the board should maintain appropriate skepticism about growth claims. Every initiative Peter Stern has announced is oriented toward making existing members more engaged and valuable — which is necessary but not sufficient for revenue growth. The company has not yet articulated a convincing plan to reverse the decline in new customer acquisition.

The three recommendations I've outlined are designed to give the board early warning signals if the strategy isn't working. Content licensing revenue is the clearest indicator of platform value beyond hardware. The subscriber floor establishes a boundary condition that would require strategic intervention. And demanding concrete growth metrics ensures management accountability.

If the February 2026 earnings call does not include quantified targets for acquisition and growth — with specific timelines and supporting unit economics — the board should consider whether the current strategy is capable of producing growth, or whether Peloton should be managed as a cash-generating business with a declining revenue trajectory.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day, and welcome to Peloton's first quarter fiscal 2025 conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. James Marsh, senior vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Peloton's first quarter fiscal 2025 conference call. Joining today's call are Peloton board members and Interim Co-CEOs Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, as well as Liz Coddington. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities law.

Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could impact our actual results, please refer to our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter, both of which can be found on our investor relations website. During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter.

I'll now turn the call over to Interim Co-CEO Karen Boone.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into today's financial results, I want to share the exciting news regarding our CEO search. As you probably saw in our separate release this morning, on behalf of the entire board, I'm thrilled to announce that after a comprehensive search, we have identified the next leader for Peloton. Peter Stern will assume the role of CEO and president on January 1st, 2025.

Peter is a seasoned leader and strategist with over 20 years of experience operating at the intersection of hardware, software, services, and content at Ford, Apple, and Time Warner Cable. He has a strong track record of innovation, operational excellence, and creating significant shareholder value. As the co-founder and driving force behind Apple Fitness Plus, Peter led its growth to millions of members and is responsible for successfully scaling over a dozen other subscription services, ranging from Ford BlueCruise to Apple iCloud, to Time Warner Cable Home Security. Importantly, Peter has also been a passionate member of the Peloton community since 2016 and has a deep appreciation and respect for this business, this brand, and the impact that we have on millions of people around the world every day.

I truly cannot wait to officially welcome him to Peloton at the start of the calendar year. Turning to our financial results. I'm extremely pleased to share that we are reiterating our fiscal 2025 financial goals today, which include: first, aligning our cost structure to the current size of our business by delivering over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal year '25 from our cost restructuring plan announced in May 2024. Second, improving our unit economics across all products and sales channels in pursuit of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and meaningful free cash flow generation.

And third, continuing to make strategic investments in innovation to enable Peloton to return to top-line growth in the long term. This includes product development in both software and hardware features, refining our marketing strategy to attract new audiences, as well as evolving our content offering to deliver more diversified, engaging fitness experiences. We believe these efforts will delight our current members and attract new ones to our strong and loyal community. Our Q1 results were strong, exceeding our guidance on all key metrics, which Liz will discuss in greater detail.

Progress on cost reduction efforts are reflected in our profitability metrics. We are proud to report Q1 results, which include $13 million of GAAP operating income, $11 million of free cash flow, and $116 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our results also highlight the continued strength of our category-leading connected fitness subscription business, which has over 6 million loyal members, 2.9 million connected fitness subscribers, 586,000 app subscribers and over $1.7 billion of annualized subscription revenue was 68% gross margin. I am thrilled to see our cost reduction efforts materialize in our financial performance to date.

And I must say the team has done an incredible job not only to deliver but to exceed our goals thus far in reducing costs. A key part of managing our business toward profitable growth involves ensuring all the subscribers we acquire are profitable and ensuring we have sustainable unit economics. We manage our business through a lens of LTV to CAC and have taken actions to improve the areas that are in our immediate control on both the LTV and the CAC side of the equation. To enhance customer LTV, we are focused on expanding connected fitness products' gross margin across all of our products, sales channels, and markets, leading us to make certain pricing changes and reduce promotional activity in Q1.

We are investing in marketing, product, and content initiatives to drive engagement, which will improve subscriber growth and retention over the long term. We also launched the used equipment activation fee, which increases the LTV for new customers who joined Peloton via the secondary market. Chris will talk in more detail about what we're doing to reduce our customer acquisition costs as well. Some of the pricing changes I mentioned were specific to our international business, where we raised the price for all of our bike products in all international markets in the first quarter to expand connected fitness product gross margin.

This was especially important in Germany, where we transitioned our operations to an entirely third-party retail and distribution model. This means that while our first-party website will remain live to serve as a brand awareness and product education platform, we are now directing traffic to third-party retailers, namely Amazon and FitShop for sales and fulfillment. Germany sales have outperformed our internal expectations following the third-party transition. We are optimistic that this channel strategy could provide a more capital-efficient model to explore expansion into additional international markets over time.

Paid connected fitness subscribers in our international markets grew 8% in Q1. We remain bullish on international as a source for long-term growth based on the strong retention and engagement trends that mirror those in our North America business. We continue to optimize our sales channel strategy for stronger unit economics in our North American business as well. In Q1, we continued our efforts to close underperforming first-party retail stores.

Next month, we will test the reimagined smaller store concept in Nashville, Tennessee to evaluate a more cost-efficient retail model. We also expanded third-party and online retail capabilities ahead of the all-important holiday season. On our website, we launched an exciting partnership with Truemed in early October, which makes it easier for qualified U.S.-based customers to use pre-tax, HSA or FSA dollars to purchase Peloton products. We are also pleased to announce that for the first time, the Peloton Bike Plus will be available at Costco this holiday season with special pricing across 300 U.S.

locations and at costco.com. All of these changes position us well to capture the seasonally strong holiday demand with healthier unit economics, delivering stronger connected fitness gross margins and free cash flow. There is so much great work being done to optimize our channel and go-to-market strategies, improve our unit economics and gross margins, and rearchitect our cost structure. All of this has made Peloton a more sustainable and profitable business.

One that is better equipped to serve our members and grow our business over the long term. I will now pass the call over to Chris, who will provide an update on our innovation efforts across marketing, products, and content where we are making thoughtful investments to drive sustainable, profitable growth.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Karen. As Karen mentioned, we're focused on improving the efficiency of our customer acquisition costs. And this requires us to be strategic with our marketing campaign that generates demand from target growth audiences and to be disciplined with our marketing spend. In that way, we reduced total sales and marketing expense by $64 million or 44% year over year in Q1, primarily driven by historically low media spend in the quarter.

In fact, our Q1 was the lowest quarter of media spend since fiscal 2020 over four years ago. We intentionally pulled back our media spend during Q1 because it is a seasonally low hardware sales period for us. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we are already ramping up media spend to support demand generation ahead of this important time for hardware sales and subscriber additions. Our go-to-market strategy continues to evolve with a balanced approach that creates demand among new growth audiences, coupled with improved efficiency in our short-term conversion tactics.

Today, two-thirds of our members are women. So, we see an opportunity to attract more men to Peloton through targeting and messaging that highlights the robust value of a Peloton membership. Further, we see an opportunity to grow our tread business, given our estimates that show the at-home treadmill market is more than twice the size of the at-home stationary bike market. Our goal is to build demand among core audiences and capture that demand during less frequent promotional moments.

While we are still in early days, we're encouraged by the signal that suggests these marketing strategies are working. In Q1, we saw a 9% year-over-year mix shift in hardware sales toward men with the highest shift in our tread portfolio. All of these efforts will enable us to expand LTV to CAC year over year while refining a marketing approach to better support sustainable and profitable demand growth in the long term. While our LTV to CAC ratio improved significantly in Q1 to 1.9x, it was still slightly below our target of greater than 2x during the period with historically low media spend.

As our media spend and promotional activity increased in Q2 to drive demand creation and conversion during the holiday shopping season, it's worth noting that many of the customers acquired during Q2 will not activate their subscription until Q3. As a result, there will be some quarterly swings in LTV to CAC similar to what we've seen in prior years. We consistently evaluate the overall picture of LTV to CAC on a full year basis to inform decisions about quarterly media investments. Now beyond our marketing efforts, product development plays a key role in driving long-term growth as well.

This includes both hardware and software innovation. Recently, we launched a number of software updates that are designed to drive higher engagement from our members by offering alternative workouts, a greater level of personalization, and more social engagement on our platform. While we are encouraged by early results, all of these software updates are still in an early test phase, and we expect some of these software initiatives to be more effective than others. Our development approach prioritizes getting early versions to market sooner, so that we can test how customers respond and iterate accordingly.

This allows us to be nimble, scaling investments up or down with the results we see. Strength is the second most popular modality in our platform, and it continues to take share. In September, we launched a public beta test for a new app offering called Strength Plus in order to deliver Strength training programs that are designed for use in a gym setting. These are non-class-based workouts and customizable to address the member's specific goals.

We have gathered more than 70,000 sign-ups to date of people who are interested in trying Strength Plus. We are getting productive feedback from our test population of 5,000 that is informing our product iterations. Beyond expanded Strength offerings, our members have shown considerable interest in game-inspired fitness experiences. In fact, over 10% of our active subscribers engaged with Lanebreak in Q1, our first-game-inspired fitness offering.

So, we are currently testing our second game-inspired experience in a closed beta of 100 existing Bike Plus members. We're building this to deliver an immersive, social, and competitive workout experience. We also believe a greater level of personalization will enhance the value of Peloton to our members. Among the small population of our existing members, we are testing a new software feature called personalized plans which provides a weekly workout plan both in our app and through our connected fitness hardware based on our member's individual fitness goals.

Our goals for personalized plans include both improving retention for new members who may need help getting started on our platform, as well as driving higher engagement among our existing members to enhance the value Peloton brings to their workout routine. Now we know that there is extensive social engagement among our members happening off of our connected fitness platform. So, we're making changes to enable our members to engage with one another. We recently launched Private Teams, a new feature where existing members can share results and compete and challenges.

Team creation and adoption is pacing well, and it's aligned with our expectations. Early results show members who joined Teams are both increasing workouts taken and connecting other members via Find Friends at a faster pace than prior to joining Teams, demonstrating healthy signals of a growing network effect. Okay, so beyond our exciting software initiatives, we're proud to continue delighting our members with our best-in-class instructor-led fitness content. Which delivered strong engagement results in Q1 that were relatively stable year over year and well above pre-COVID levels.

Our annual All for One Programming Event included various popular musicians and a live performance from Keith Urban in-studio. These offer All for One classes generated over 26,000 live member workouts and over 900,000 workouts on demand in the first week available on the platform. We also rolled out a number of new offerings to serve our members' diverse interest, including Strength for Soccer and new programs across barre, Pilates, yoga, and meditation. We expanded our treadmill modalities by launching walking boot camps, which are excellent lower-impact workout options for members and the latest in a series of content options for walking and hiking.

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.

We ended the quarter with 2.9 million paid connected fitness subscribers, reflecting a net decrease of 81,000 in the quarter. This exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10,000 subscribers. The main driver of our subscriber outperformance was slightly favorable churn versus our expectations as a result of fewer subscription pauses. This favorability was partly offset by slightly softer gross additions than we expected.

Average net monthly paid connected fitness subscription churn was 1.9%, slightly favorable versus expectations and in line with the prior quarter and an increase of roughly 40 basis points year over year. As a reminder, our net churn performance from the year-ago period included a one-time benefit as a result of elevated subscription unpauses in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, following elevated pauses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 in response to our original bike seatpost recall. We ended the first quarter with 582,000 paid app subscriptions, reflecting a net decrease of 33,000 in the quarter. This result exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 12,000 from both higher additions and better-than-expected average monthly paid app subscription churn, which was 7.1% in the quarter.

In the first quarter, we've continued to scale back the amount of media spend dedicated to support growth in paid app subscriptions to maximize media efficiency. As we continue evolving our app with software enhancements, such as personalized plans and Private Teams, and developing new app offerings like our Strength Plus beta. We may elect to invest more in-app media if we see signals that suggest we can accelerate growth of app subscribers efficiently. Total revenue was $586 million in the first quarter, comprising $160 million of connected fitness products revenue and $426 million of subscription revenue.

connected fitness products revenue was down 12% year over year due to lower hardware demand and subscription revenue was up 3% year over year due to content licensing revenue from lululemon and Google Fitbit. Total revenue was above the high end of our $560 million to $580 million guidance range, primarily due to higher subscription revenue as a result of higher paid connected fitness and paid app subscribers than we expected, as well as slightly higher connected fitness products revenue. As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonally lower period for hardware sales, which is reflected in the revenue mix of 27% connected fitness and 73% subscription for the quarter. Total gross profit was $304 million in the first quarter, an increase of $18 million or 6% year over year.

Total gross margin was 51.8% and 180 basis points above guidance due to favorable connected fitness product segment gross margin and revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Connected fitness product gross margin was 9.2%, ahead of internal expectations and up 600 basis points year over year, primarily driven by product mix shifts toward higher-margin Precor and bike rental products reduced personnel-related expenses, and lower warehousing costs, partly offset by higher expenses associated with our standard warranty reserves. Subscription gross margin was 67.8%, in line with internal expectations and up 40 basis points year over year. Total operating expenses, including restructuring and impairment expenses, were $291 million in the first quarter, a $126 million or 30% reduction year over year, reflecting the progress we've made thus far toward rightsizing our cost structure.

We are tracking ahead of our cost savings targets across all expense buckets. General and administrative expenses were $120 million, a decrease of $32 million or 21% year over year, primarily driven by lower payroll, stock-based compensation, and professional service fees. We are pleased with the progress we've made on reducing G&A expense thus far, but we recognize the need to reduce G&A as a percentage of revenue over time and see opportunities to do so. Sales and marketing expenses were $82 million, a decrease of $64 million or 44% year over year, primarily from lower spending on media, payroll, and stock-based compensation.

As Chris mentioned, we intentionally reduced Q1 media spend 57% year over year. However, we have already begun ramping our media spending this quarter in preparation for the holiday season. And while we still expect media spend to be down year over year in Q2, we expect less of a reduction compared to Q1. Research and development expenses were $59 million, a decrease of $20 million or 26% year over year, primarily driven by reductions in payroll, stock-based compensation, and product development costs.

This quarter, we recognized $8 million of impairment and restructuring expense, of which $5 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exit. The cash charges consisted of $3 million in exit and disposal costs and professional fees, offset by a $0.5 million net benefit from lower severance and other personnel costs. We also recognized $24 million of supplier settlements due to accruals in the first quarter related to settlement of a dispute with a third-party supplier.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA outperformance included roughly $15 million of timing savings within the fiscal year. We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Liz. I want to take a moment to recognize the remarkable progress the entire Peloton team has made since I took on the role of interim co-CEO with Karen in May. In a relatively short time, I've seen us get smarter in many ways. We've made meaningful progress toward our goals of rightsizing our cost structure, improving unit economics, and innovating to drive long-term profitable growth, and we are just getting started.

So, with today's announcement that Peter Stern will start as Peloton's next CEO and President in January, I will be stepping down as Co-CEO effective tomorrow, November 1st. Karen has graciously agreed to continue as interim CEO of Peloton until Peter arrives. It has been a great experience working with Karen, Liz, the lead team, and the many talented team members here at Peloton. I am very proud to be part of Peloton for the difference we make in millions of lives every day.

And I look forward to staying very involved as a much smarter board Director going forward. Thank you for the time this morning. We can now open the line for Q&A.
Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Again, due to time restraints we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets.

Your line is open.

Simeon Siegel -- Analyst

Thanks. Morning, everyone. Congrats on the ongoing progress and on the new CEO announcement. It's really great to see.

So, some really nice momentum here on the profitability trajectory. So, Karen, recognizing I'm about to ask you something to speak on someone else's behalf. I guess I was hoping you could speak to how you think or expect Peter would approach the balance of growth and profitability. I'm wondering, do you expect any actions that he takes will flow quickly once he starts? Do you think he's going to have a taking stock period? It just it seems like you've all done a really nice job of diagnosing the problem and you're already successfully affecting that plan to improve the free cash flow.

So, I'm just curious if we can assume that, that continues or whether it's a wait and see and then we'll watch how Peter wants to approach the business anew. Thank you.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Simeon. It's absolutely on our mind. It's absolutely the right question, it's how we're going to balance profitability and growth, and it was, frankly, top of mind for the board as we were looking for the next CEO. Peter is the right CEO for this chapter.

He's a seasoned strategist. He's known for execution and he does have that strong track record of driving innovation and growth. I will pause and just say, I do think we've set the table for his arrival, job one was refinancing the debt in May, we did that, we stabilized the balance sheet and it's put us in a much better position to manage our maturities. And Liz has talked a lot about the progress on executing the restructuring reducing inventory levels, focused on profitability to generate the cash flow to allow us to begin deleveraging.

So, we do feel like we now have that stable base upon which to grow. In the very near term, and I don't know how long this is going to last, we have been managing an uncertain macro environment, an uncertain consumer backdrop. There's been weather and hurricanes. We have a very intense focus on the election.

So, we've been focusing on what we can control. I don't expect that to change under Peter's leadership. We've been very clear that we're not going to chase unprofitable sub-growth. And we've been much more disciplined with spend up and down the P&L.

Our media and marketing investments have been much more thoughtful, and we're optimizing our unit economics by product and by channel. So, those are the things that I do not expect to change where we're going to continue to monitor those and kind of see when it makes sense to turn back on some of the growth spending and more meaningful ways. But I guess, make no mistake that that's not kind of where the story ends. Innovation and growth are still very important to us.

It's an and, it's a both, we are making investments in content, in product development, both software and hardware, and marketing growth is important for this very important holiday period where we are unlocking marketing dollars. And again, this is going to be a big part, Peter is going to be a big part of this equation. He has the relevant experience. He has the track record and a large portion of his compensation is going to be designed to balance those and drive both profitability and growth.

So, his incentives are well aligned with those goals. I think, of course, he's going to have one of the things I love about him is, he absolutely has a growth mindset. So, of course, I think he's going to have a taking stock period. I think we want him to come in and learn what has worked, what has not worked before he just kind of fires before he aims and learns.

So, I do think there'll be a taking stock period. But I'm really excited about his arrival. He is, I believe the guy who is going to come in and set the strategy that is going to return us to growth. He is very bullish.

We all are very bullish on the health and wellness space, the share of wallet that is going to go to this category. So, again, he's going to spend time learning. We will spend time aligning on where to go, how quickly to invest. And again, I do believe he's the right leader to return us to growth.

And I do believe strongly that under his leadership, our brand is well-positioned to be a long-term player and the absolute leader in this category.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

As you can tell from Karen's remarks there, she and I have been very involved in this process, and with Peter in particular. And so, we're very excited. He's really aligned. All those conversations have been so positive.

So, we know we've got the right leader that's going to bring the right balance and focus on growth.

Simeon Siegel -- Analyst

I can say the excitement is resonating. So, that's great. So, thanks, guys. And then if I could just follow up quickly on that, maybe for Liz.

A quick one. It's not a lot, but I think this is the first quarter of sequential inventory growth in a long time. So, any help on the composition of that inventory? Any way to frame what type of equipment is making up that increase? And I guess I'm asking not as much for the number. I'm just wondering if we should be reading into that as a signal that maybe you do see some uptick in demand ahead or maybe it's the build for the new distribution partners or am I just way off and it's a nonevent and it's just a function of maybe the lighter gross side as you mentioned.

So, any help on that inventory vis-a-vis the growth comment would be helpful.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So, the question, I believe, is around our sequential growth in inventory for the first quarter. As we said it's pretty modest, it's pretty modest, and it's really related to our seasonal buildup of inventory ahead of the holiday season, and we do expect a significant inventory tailwind on the full year. We've done some great work, our supply chain team has done some excellent work in working with our manufacturing partners to reduce our production levels over the course of the year to enable us to be a lot more efficient with our inventory over time and reduce our days of on-hand inventory, which is great.

And that will create a cash tailwind for us over the course of the year. In Q1, it's up very slightly, but that's in relation to just the seasonality of buying ahead of the holiday season, and we expect our inventory balances to come down over the course of the year. But we are, just to be clear, producing inventory for all of our products, because we do need that inventory over the course of the year. But we do see it as an overall tailwind for us on a full year basis.

Simeon Siegel -- Analyst

Sounds great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the holiday and a nice job.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of Curt Nagle with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Unknown Speaker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Congrats on the solid quarter. This is Kemunto on for Curt Nagle. This quarter churn came in line at a seasonally high period. What are we factoring for the rest of the year? Would that be a stable rate compared to the last year for the remaining quarters?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So, first, let's take a step back. Our business continues to benefit from very strong subscriber retention and low churn overall. In Q1, our average net monthly churn was 1.9%, which was relatively in line with last quarter.

It was up 40 basis points year over year. As we discussed during the last quarter earnings call, we expected Q1 net churn to be up year over year due to a few reasons, including the following: slightly worse overall retention from our 1P and 3P subscriber base, which we've talked about, mix shift toward secondary market subscribers, which do have a slightly lower retention than our first-party subscribers. And then we also had the impact of a one-time benefit in Q1 of fiscal '24 related to higher subscription on pauses following elevated pauses in Q4 of fiscal '23 related to our original bike seatpost recall, and we did not repeat that benefit this year. As we move forward and look at Q2, we do expect our churn to improve seasonally compared to Q1 and we do expect that improvement would likely be a bit muted though compared to quarter-over-quarter improvement that we saw in fiscal '24, again, because of those two headwinds that I mentioned about the slightly worse retention in our overall subscriber base and that mix shift into secondary subscriptions, which do have that higher churn profile.

So, overall, for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our churn to continue to be higher year over year because of the mix of subscribers from the secondary market continuing to grow but we do expect churn to remain below 2% for the whole of fiscal 2025. I do want to point out though, and we've mentioned this before, that our guidance doesn't assume any potential upside to subscriber retention as a result of the software innovation initiatives that Chris talked about earlier, which we believe could positively impact member engagement and ultimately, retention over time. And the reason we haven't incorporated those is because the magnitude and timing of those benefits is uncertain at this point.

Unknown Speaker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Great. Thank you.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.

Brian Nagel -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. I too would like to add my congratulations on the business and your CEO announcement. My question, so first question, I've got two, I'll ask them in order. First, just on the balance sheet, you talked in your prepared comments about '25 being a deleverage year.

So, I guess the question I have there is maybe if you can go into a little more detail. Clearly, the business now from the P&L standpoint is much more stable. You're generating cash flow. But are there any specific steps you can identify here to address the balance sheet, in particular, the debt that remains on the balance sheet?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. This is Liz. I'll start that one and folks can add on. So, first of all, Karen mentioned earlier that we derisked our balance sheet with the refinancing in May, and that allows us to now be very focused on deleveraging over time.

And we're also very excited to be talking about the positive free cash flow and also raising our minimum free cash flow target. We are being disciplined with the level of investments that we're making, and that's the goal there is to set us up for future growth that is sustainable and profitable. And so, as a result of generating that meaningful free cash flow, we do see the opportunity to meaningfully deleverage going forward and that we're going to continue to improve our adjusted EBITDA and then continue to generate that positive free cash flow. And when we do that, we will naturally deleverage.

We also see, over the course of time, real interest cost savings with rate step-downs when our leverage ratio falls below 5. And then eventually, there is also the potential conversion of our 2029, 5.5% convertible notes. So, our balance sheet is in a much better position than it's been in the past. We've lowered risks.

We've positioned ourselves well for sustainable and profitable growth. And we also see the ability to strategically reduce our gross debt over time, and we will be strategic about that. But we don't have anything to share regarding a definitive capital allocation framework for how we're going to execute that at this time.

Brian Nagel -- Analyst

That's very helpful. Go ahead, sorry.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Did you have a follow-up question?

Brian Nagel -- Analyst

I did, and thank you for that. And my follow-up question is unrelated, but I guess somewhat bigger picture, too, and maybe a little, it's probably a better question as your new management team takes place. But if you look at the, I mean, I guess, I'm looking at the business, one of the positives has been the ability of Peloton to really maintain that core base, and you talked just a few minutes ago, about a moment ago about your still very low churn. But as you're watching the business, and if you stabilize the business, are you finding, is there anything you can help us with this, like where you're finding those incremental pockets of new demand, those new customers that could come into the Peloton system?

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, this is Chris. That's a great question. And I think it goes straight to the kind of discipline that we've been talking about in marketing. A key part of that is who are you reaching and what's the opportunity and what's the message and how are you doing that efficiently.

And I think we've had some really great success just recently in focusing on men. In the prepared remarks, you heard me talk about two-thirds of our current members are women. And so now we're targeting the male demographic in our advertising. We've done some more buys during NFL games.

We featured the Watt Brothers. But more importantly, the campaign and the work that we're doing is expanding our reach, and we're seeing in the data that there's a shift toward men and new hardware purchases and with the greatest shift within that in the tread and tread plus products. So, we feel really good about that. And it's just an indicator of the way we're thinking about the marketplace now, which is targeting, as you said, targeting those discrete pockets and then being efficient and effective in the way that we're reaching them.

I should point out that here in November, we're going to be holding a lot of member gratitude events and messages, and that's another core part of this, activating that incredibly loyal base to refer and engage their friends and family to bring them into the Peloton experience, you're going to see us do a lot more of that.

Brian Nagel -- Analyst

Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thank you.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Operator, next question, please.

Operator

One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Nathan Feather with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Nathan Feather -- Analyst

Hey, everyone, thanks for taking the question and really encouraging to see the progress on profitability. As you think about how to drive sustainable profitable growth. Interested to hear how you're thinking about where physical retail fits in as a component of your go-to-market and especially given the Costco launch. Do you see some portion of the customer base who are more willing to convert in person than online and then reflecting on the owned stores, interested to hear where you see the potential to improve performance versus the prior format.

Thank you.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Sure. This is Karen. So, on retail in general, I'd say we are still on the path to closing some of the underperforming retail stores. That said, we will have them this holiday season.

So, the team has put together some really thoughtful activations in a subset of those stores to bring instructors and magic and excitement to them to make sure they're still representing the brand well and can engage with our members and new customers and have some excitement around these spaces. We are testing to the point on how we might reimagine it, we're testing a smaller micro store concept in Nashville. So, it's a way to do it in a lower capital, lower payroll, lower square footage but still have a physical presence. It's also the reason why we are exploring additional 3P locations like Costco.

We're hoping that reaches an incremental audience. We're still excited about a lot of people shop on Amazon. We're happy to be there and trust Amazon with the part of their daily routine. And then we still have the DICK'S Sporting Goods, internationally 3P is important, too, and it's a much more capital-efficient way for us to roll out.

So, retail, I would say, is in the reimagined process. It's not going anywhere. It's just we're going to kind of optimize the mix between 3P and 1P and make sure that it makes economic sense and reaches as many new incremental buyers as possible.

Nathan Feather -- Analyst

Great. That's helpful. And then given the more flexible international model you talked about in Germany and Austria, interested to hear how you're thinking about potential further international expansion. And is distribution the primary constraint to growth? Or is it more on the localized content side?

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Sure. So, international is still another important part of the long-term growth strategy for us, it's just a matter of prioritization and sequencing. I do think we've made some very important steps. Germany is the example where we are entirely 3P now.

So, in order to do that and do that profitably and effectively, we had to make some pricing changes. We need to make sure there's sufficient margin for that third party to have some margin, and it still makes economic sense for us to do so. So, now we have in a couple of different models, and we can test and see which ones, we're still learning what makes sense and how much to invest as we roll it out. But there's not one limiting factor.

It's just how do we want to sequence and prioritize the various investments. But I would say we're really excited about the way the international model has taken shape, again, both with the way we've taken some of the investments on the people side and centralize those. And then also with the pricing, it's just a better go-to-market strategy. So, we will expand over time.

We have no new plans to talk about markets right now. So, that's something that as Peter gets onboarded, we'll evaluate additional investments in current markets and/or new markets we want to go into overtime. But it's still a very important part of the long-term strategy.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

And it's really about, it's not so much about barriers as it is about as we're thoughtful about our priorities, we have to be thoughtful about making an experience that meets the bar. And so, the content does have to be relevant and localized. And so, you're going to see us be thoughtful about that. And if we're expanding international markets, we're going to do it in a way that we're proud of.

Nathan Feather -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst

Hello. Can you hear me?

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yes, we can hear you.

Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst

OK. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, could you please talk about how you came to the decision with Peter as the CEO, it seems like he has phenomenal experience, especially as it relates to Apple Plus or Fitness experience with Apple, which is translatable. But as you were going through different candidates, what specifically about Peter, do you think will jump out as he comes on board? Thanks a ton.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Well, I couldn't be more excited. This is a fun one to talk about. Peter just really hits and checks a lot of the boxes that we were looking for.

As you mentioned, his experience, not just the Apple Fitness Plus, but really, he has a ton of breadth of experience across hardware, software, and content businesses across services, but he's also had a lot of experience driving growth through innovation, and that's where we are in our journey. As we've kind of talked about. We have the stable base. We now need to return to growth.

And I also just really believe he's highly aligned with Peloton's core values. He has been a member for eight years. He loves what we're doing. He loves health and wellness.

It's part of his own routine and his own regimen. So, I think he believes in the product. He believes in the space. He has a perfect skill set and experience set, and I just think he's going to be a great fit.

So, we're just really, really excited to get him started.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

It's hard to add anything to that. I would just say on a personal level, he's thoughtful, he's considerate, he's going to definitely bring an approach to learning, which I think is excellent. And he deeply appreciates what Peloton has done, and he's excited about helping to lead the next chapter.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is open.

Andrew Boone -- Analyst

Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to double-click on the reduction in marketing this quarter. Can you guys talk about the learnings as you guys did pull back there? And what may be incremental and then as we think about that 2 to 3x kind of LTV to CAC target, can you guys talk about the path back into that framework? And then for my second question is I'd love to double-click in terms of connected fitness gross profit margins, you guys have seen steady improvement there. Is that kind of the ceiling? Or do you guys feel like there's more progress to go? How does that move into a step function and maybe in the double digits? Thanks so much.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I mean I'll start and then Liz, you can chime in. I think I would say the word at the topic as it relates to marketing is discipline. And I talked about it in the prepared remarks, I talked about it earlier in the Q&A, but effective audience targeting, being effective in the way that we're optimizing our investments, the way that we're focused on the entire picture, marketing picture, including the retention and engagement of our existing members.

These are kind of the key hallmarks of what Lauren Weinberg, our CMO, has brought in this last year to Peloton. We've gone from being promotion-heavy to a place where we're now balancing demand creation and desire with those moments where we can capture demand through conversion events. And promotions and seasonal opportunities like we have coming up in the holiday and then you see the numbers. We've significantly reduced our customer acquisition costs.

We've become much more disciplined in our media spending and a lot more focused on where are those qualified growth audiences. So, all of these areas, I'm really impressed with what Lauren and her team have done and the way they, I think, set up Peloton as part of this broader effort at the company to create a solid foundation of sustainable and profitable growth. So, you can expect that to continue.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

So, on the question around the LTV to CAC and the path back to getting to that 2x to 3x. So, our goal is to get to that 2 to 3x range, ideally closer to 3, we do have some work to get there. We're not quite there yet. And we have these near-term levers that we are focused on that are under our control.

And then as Chris was talking a lot about investing in future growth. So, the pricing changes that we've made and the reduced promotional activity that you saw in Q1 are way for us to improve our gross margins. So, we made progress on those in Q1 and as we go into Q2, we will still have promotions over the holidays, but we will continue to make progress on our LTV by improving our gross margins over time. And ultimately, our goal is to get to where we have significant positive gross margins across all products, all channels, and all markets.

The other piece is around our CAC, which Chris was talking about, that's really about the discipline, not overspending to acquire unprofitable customers. And then also evolving our messaging to target those audiences in order to drive that efficiency. And then we also have in addition to kind of the working media dollars that we invest in marketing. We're also focused on those nonmedia costs that do hit our sales and marketing and impact our CAC, and that includes things like exiting retail showrooms, which Karen talked a little bit about earlier, optimizing our brand and creative spend and also optimizing our headcount.

So, we've been focused on all of those things. Now I think the last part of your question was around connected fitness gross margin and do we have ability to make more progress. We certainly have the ability to make more progress over time. Again, we're really focused on the things that we can control, and you're seeing some of the progress there manifest.

And then we will do the right thing in terms of LTV to CAC and if it does make sense to invest a bit more in the LTV side of the equation relative to the CAC side of the equation. We will continue to make those trade-offs as we go. But our goal is to continue to drive improvement in gross margin because that helps us fund our CAC and create a lot of that efficiency that we're looking for. Our holidays are an example, seasonally higher demand, we will be spending on media in that quarter, and that will drive growth into the future quarters, and we will also be spending on promotions in that quarter.

One other thing I want to mention is that Precor does sit within our connected fitness segment, and it's accretive to our connected fitness gross margin overall. So, as the Precor business grows, that will also drive higher connected fitness margins over time.

Andrew Boone -- Analyst

And the connected fitness margin, OK.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Next question, please.

Operator

One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.

Brian Smilek -- Analyst

Great. It's Brian Smilek on for Doug. I guess just as you enter the holiday season, can you just talk about which go-to-market channels and initiatives are key to just driving improving seasonality and higher hardware sales and then I know we've talked about it in the past, too, but can you just provide an update where the connected fitness industry is and the overall cadence of return to growth and rate of declines? Thanks.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

I'll take the holiday question, and Liz, you can take that on. Yeah, thanks for the question. I mean we're entering the holiday season with cautious optimism. I think we talked about macroeconomic factors that are out of our control, but we're focused on things that are within our control.

And I'm just going to be a broken record, and you can expect us to spend this in a disciplined way. We'll spend less on media this year. We'll be less promotional than we were in our holiday season last year. And we will continue to manage our LTV to CAC ratios in the right way.

But we're excited about, as I mentioned, ways of getting existing members engaged and involved through referrals. The way we're targeting pockets of growth and new third-party relationships like the one we just discussed today related to Costco. So, when we can do things like have our Bike Plus available with special bundled pricing and extended warranty like we're doing at Costco, that's another great opportunity. So, we have a strong plan.

We're prepared and I think we're going to focus well this holiday season.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

So, I think the last question was a bit about the connected fitness industry overall. So, we do track with third-party data the market share data around connected fitness and market share trends. Our data suggests that the overall fitness market declined around 2% year over year in Q1. We're seeing that gyms are settling into a new normal growing around 3% to 4% year over year in the last couple of quarters compared to 8% to 9% year-over-year growth that they were experiencing in Q1 and Q2 of fiscal '24.

For the connected fitness hardware sales piece, sales overall are continuing to decline year over year. So, gyms are still taking a bit of a share. However, we are such a large part of the connected fitness market. The decisions that we are making to prioritize profitability are certainly impacting this trend.

Some of the other things that we're seeing are, there are macroeconomic factors like the impact of inflation, interest rates, and uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections that could be playing into overall connected fitness hardware sales in general. And then so just for us, we're focused on the things that we can control, which is really focusing on sustainable and profitable growth and then ensuring that we create the best possible experience for new and existing members that are joining our Peloton community.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Thank you. Operator, maybe we have time for one last question.

Operator

And that will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Eric Sheridan -- Analyst

Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Maybe just one question on content. As you continue to sort of build learnings around the business and think about where the strategy is going to go over the medium to longer term as Peter joins, how do you think about the right levels of investment in content, duration around content, and the role that content can play in continuing to drive sort of end demand on the user side and engagement and sort of conversion metrics over the medium to long term? Thanks so much.

Chris Bruzzo -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Yeah, thanks. Well, I mean, content is absolutely at the very center of our experience and our instructor-led content is a hallmark of what makes for a great Peloton experience. So, we're going to continue to invest there and to innovate. We've done some really interesting things just in the last quarter around bringing new hiking and walking experiences to the treadmill, walking boot camps.

We're doing some programs around taking walks after meals, which will be relevant as we approach the Thanksgiving holiday. So, there's lots still happening in that space. We talked about All for One and the music partnerships that we did there. It has been and will continue to be an area that's incredibly important to us.

And yes, I think that will continue.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

I can add one more thing. We are also investing in non-class-based content, too. So, in our entertainment offerings, in our gaming-inspired fitness experiences, which we're leaning into. And so we're seeing the opportunity to expand beyond our core, our incredible instructor-led workout, which we have all these modalities and Chris was talking about some of the new ones that we've added that we really think are going to be value-added but also those non-class ones that we are seeing gain some interest and traction, and we think we'll be able to drive engagement over time, which, again, if our subscribers are engaged, then they stick with us, and we've seen that time and time again, and we want that to continue.

Eric Sheridan -- Analyst

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Karen Boone for any closing remarks.

Karen Boone -- Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, operator. Before we end the call, I just wanted to thank Chris for all the leadership he has brought to the business over the last six months, driving our teams toward innovation and reinforcing a members-first mindset during this period, there has been a lot of transition and a lot of change. I've been really lucky to have him as my partner over the last six months in our interim co-CEO role, and we're very lucky to have him return to the board and benefit from his experience and insights going forward. I will continue the role of interim CEO through the end of the calendar year before handing the baton back to Peter in January.

And Chris and I will both be actively involved in ensuring a smooth and successful transition. I really couldn't be more excited to get Peter on board. In addition to the depth of experience he brings. He really has such a great respect for the many passionate team members who work to bring amazing experiences to our members every single day.

And I know he brings a growth mindset and curiosity to learn all about the business. He's going to bring a fresh perspective as we continue on our path to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. And lastly, I am so proud of the Peloton leadership team, the many passionate and purpose-driven team members who are devoted to Peloton's success. All the hard work and progress has really set us up to continue to deliver on our goals as we enter the next phase of Peloton's journey under Peter's leadership, and we truly can't wait to welcome him to the team.

Thank you, and happy holidays.

Operator

Thank you for standing by. My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Peloton Interactive First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to James Marsh, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

James Marsh
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Peloton's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Conference Call. Joining today's call are Peloton Chief Executive Officer and President, Peter Stern; and Chief Financial Officer, Liz Coddington.

Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include forward-looking statements related to our business under federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. Please refer to our SEC filings and today's press release, both of which can be found on our Investor Relations website, for a discussion of our material risks and other important factors that could impact our results.

During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's press release.

I'll now turn the call over to Peter.

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, James. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I summarize our performance in Q1, I'd like to address our voluntary recall announced earlier today. As previously disclosed, we have received a small number of reports of an Original Series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of 3 such incidents. The well-being of our members is our highest priority. And therefore, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, we are voluntarily recalling approximately 833,000 units in the U.S. and approximately 44,800 units in Canada of the Original Series Bike+ model. These units were manufactured from December 2019 to July 2022 and sold beginning in 2020 to April 2025.

We are offering an updated self-installable seat post replacement, which is the CPSC approved remedy. Impacted members will receive an e-mail with order instructions and the notification will also appear on their Bike+ touchscreen. This recall does not impact any other equipment models, including our new Cross Training Series Bike and Bike+. The anticipated financial impact is reflected in our results and our guidance, including the increases to our adjusted EBITDA guidance and minimum free cash flow target. Liz will share more details about the financial impact later in this call.

Turning our attention to the first quarter of the fiscal year. I am proud of Peloton. In the quarter leading up to our October 1 innovation reveal, our team once again successfully executed on our business priorities, progressed our financial results and delivered positive human impact at scale. As a result, our performance came in above the guidance range on most key financial metrics in this seasonally slower quarter for fitness equipment sales, and we continue to see year-over-year growth in average workout time per Connected Fitness subscription. Looking from the outside in during the first quarter, it may have felt like business as usual, as we continue to demonstrate financial discipline and established a strong foundation for achieving our full year financial guidance. But behind the scenes, the quarter was anything but.

Throughout the quarter, the Peloton team was hard at work, setting the stage for our new chapter by innovating on every aspect of our magic formula of premium equipment, software powered by AI, world-class instructors and a deeply engaged community. In last quarter's remarks, I laid out Peloton's strategy. The first and most foundational part of that strategy is our commitment to improving member outcomes. To that end, on October 1, we simultaneously unveiled and began shipping the most significant product update in our history with an all-new equipment lineup, the Peloton Cross Training Series and the Peloton Pro series.

Our understanding of human health has progressed since Peloton took the world by storm with the introduction of the original bike. And today, we know that adults need to pursue a combination of cardio, strength and more to achieve their wellness goals. To that end, all Peloton products now feature advanced swivel screens, allowing members to easily transition between cardio and strength to complete floor workouts, including strength, yoga, Pilates and stretching. Our new Plus line includes an advanced computer vision movement tracking camera that counts your reps, corrects your form and offers weight suggestions in real time, along with voice control, enabling members to adjust weights, skip moves or pause their workout without touching a thing.

We've made several additional upgrades, including improvements in audio across the board and featuring sound by Sonos in our Plus line for a studio-like experience. On October 1, we also launched Peloton IQ, which gives every Peloton member a personalized coach regardless of whether they own our new Cross Training Series, our Original Series or work out with a Peloton app subscription. Peloton IQ uses AI to turn years of insights and data points, including your goals, class activity and health stats from wearable devices into personal training guidance. In so doing, Peloton IQ makes some of the benefits of personal training accessible to millions of people, providing individual insights and recommendations based on members' intentions, preferences, level of fitness and performance.

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

We also announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the Hospital for Special Surgery, the world leader in orthopedics to offer Peloton members access to expert care for joint and muscle pain, injuries and orthopedic conditions. We've co-developed class collections with HSS medical experts, recently launching the first 5 on preventing some of the most common types of injuries. We're also committed to meeting members where they are in their life stages. In response to member demand, we started with menopause, a life stage that impacts the majority of our members at some point in their lives. We're extremely proud of our partnership with Respin Health, founded by Halle Berry to revolutionize menopause care with an integrated holistic approach, and have just launched a study with over 1,000 women to measure the benefits of targeted movement strategies and other evidence-based lifestyle interventions. These findings will power our evolving evidence-based exercise programming and menopause support.

The second part of our strategy is to meet members everywhere. We have made great progress on this front over the past few weeks. We now have 10 micro stores in the U.S., up from 1 prior to Q1. And we also announced a new retail partnership with Johnson Fitness & Wellness, the nation's largest independent fitness retailer with 100 locations across the U.S. We now have a physical retail presence in 46 states, while in Australia, we launched a retail presence in 11 franchise locations throughout the country. Our expanded retail footprint positions us well for the holiday season, providing opportunities for consumers to test and experience our new innovations.

Our commercial business unit continues to show strong performance and is an area in which we are also innovating. The new Peloton Pro series offers a complete lineup of Peloton equipment for commercial environments such as hotel gyms and multi-residential buildings, and includes the Tread+ Pro, Peloton's first ever commercial treadmill. And Precor launched its new commercial Tread, the Breakaway. This new slat belt treadmill includes a sled-style push mode, cadence coach and a new console design. Peloton also recently became the primary fitness partner powering Utah City, a 700-acre mixed-use development outside of Salt Lake City. And now every residential building in Utah City will feature a Peloton space that includes several pieces of Peloton equipment and accessories for residents.

The third part of our strategy is to make members for life. Celebrating achievement is crucial for sticking with any program. So last month, we launched Club Peloton, our first loyalty and recognition program. As members engage with our platform, they progress through levels from bronze to legend, unlocking exclusive content recognition and rewards. Already more than 500,000 members have engaged with Club Peloton. On October 1, we also introduced official Peloton teams led by Peloton instructors, including Move for Life, Menopause, HYROX and Cross Training. These teams provide a forum for members to connect, discuss goals and learn from each other and from experts, further elevating Peloton's community. Since October 1, engagement with teams is up nearly 50%.

Ultimately, all these strategic initiatives, product innovation, wellness expansion and new distribution are underpinned by the fourth part of our strategy, our commitment to operational discipline and business excellence. Our full year guidance announced in August included targeted initiatives to improve monetization, such as the introduction of expert assembly fees. These were implemented within the quarter and exceeded our expectations. At the same time, our cost reduction plans remain on track. Perhaps most important, we remain confident in our ability to inflect toward revenue growth as the fiscal year progresses, building on the actions we took in Q1 and on October 1. We continue to monitor and respond to evolving tariff policies and broader changes in the macro environment and consumer spending. While those external factors are real, our focus remains on execution and being the best fitness and wellness partner to our members.

We believe we offer an unmatched ecosystem of products and experiences to help our members invest in their health and well-being. As we enter this important holiday season, Peloton is exceptionally well positioned with great new equipment, Peloton IQ, new wellness partnerships, expanded distribution, a resurgent commercial business unit, new loyalty features, successful monetization changes and improvements in our financial performance.

I'll now pass it over to Liz, who will share more details about our Q1 financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year.

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

Subscription revenue decreased $28 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, lower content licensing revenue and lower ending paid app subscriptions, partly offset by used equipment activation fee revenue, which was introduced in late August of fiscal 2025. Total gross profit was $284 million in Q1, a decrease of $20 million or 7% year-over-year. Total gross margin was 51.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points below our guidance of 52%. Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs this quarter, in addition to $3 million we accrued in the prior quarter, representing a total estimated impact of $16.5 million. Excluding this $13.5 million charge in Q1, total gross margin would have been 54% or 200 basis points above our Q1 guidance.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we began assigning executive compensation and other corporate overhead expenses associated with our corporate facilities as we focus on driving more accountability for costs at a functional level. Prior to fiscal 2026, these costs were all recorded in G&A, but starting in Q1 are assigned across cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, G&A and R&D. Connected Fitness products gross margin was 6.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the Bike+ seat post inventory accrual I just noted. Excluding the inventory accrual, Connected Fitness products gross margin would have been 15.8%, an improvement of 660 basis points year-over-year, driven by a mix shift toward higher-margin products, lower warranty costs, a decrease in inventory reserves and lower warehousing and distribution costs.

Subscription gross margin was 68.6%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. Total operating expenses, excluding restructuring, impairment and supplier settlement expenses were $230 million in Q1, a decrease of $30 million or 12% year-over-year, reflecting the continued progress we've made in rightsizing our cost structure as well as a reduction to advertising expenses in Q1 ahead of our hardware portfolio refresh announced on October 1. We are on track to achieve our target to deliver at least $100 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2026. Sales and marketing expenses were $67 million in Q1, a decrease of $15 million or 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by decreases in acquisition, brand and creative marketing spend as well as a decrease in retail showroom expenses. As of the end of Q1, we had 7 legacy retail showrooms remaining.

Research and development expenses were $62 million in Q1, an increase of $4 million or 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by cost assignments from G&A, which were partially offset by lower product development costs from a reduction in contractor spend. General and administrative expenses were $101 million in Q1, a decrease of $19 million or 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by cost assignments to other functional areas and lower professional fees. This quarter, we recognized $13 million of impairment and restructuring expenses, of which $8 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs associated with accelerated retail store closures, while the remaining $5 million of cash charges were primarily related to exit and disposal costs and professional fees.

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

Q1 free cash flow included roughly $30 million of timing favorability. We ended Q1 with $1.104 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $64 million quarter-over-quarter. Net debt was $395 million, a decrease of $382 million or 49% year-over-year. Overall, our first quarter profitability performance has enabled us to continue deleveraging our balance sheet. Our gross leverage ratio, defined as our gross principal debt outstanding divided by trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 in Q1, a substantial improvement from the 14 in Q1 of last year.

Similarly, our net leverage ratio, defined as gross principal debt outstanding net of cash and cash equivalents divided by trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 1.1 in Q1, down from 7.5 in Q1 of last year. We believe we have more cash on the balance sheet today than we need to run the business and are evaluating opportunities to optimize our capital structure over time. In February 2026, roughly $200 million of 0% convertible notes will come due, and we intend to pay them down at that time. It's also worth noting our $1 billion term loan has a 1% call premium through May of 2026. We are mindful of the timing of when this call premium expires as we evaluate our options. We expect a refinancing to deliver a lower cost of capital and more flexibility to our capital allocation strategy.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session

James Marsh
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Liz. We'll begin the Q&A process this evening by taking a couple of questions from investors that send in their topics in advance. The first question will come from Bill, leaderboard name Pizza is Life. Bill asked, what is the market opportunity for the new commercial business unit? How will you be approaching the new geographical markets? And will you successfully integrate Precor and Peloton for a unified B2B offering? Peter?

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

Bill, I love your leaderboard name. Strategically, our commercial business unit is set up to win. First, the market opportunity is large, and we still have very low share. And when I talk to gym operators, they all tell me that there's only one brand that consumers ask for by name, and that's Peloton. Second, the combination of Precor and Peloton just makes sense. You think about Precor's brawn coming together with Peloton's brains, and you've got something no one else can match. And let me explain what I mean by that because we've got plenty of smart people over on the Precor team. Precor builds equipment that is truly commercial grade. It's the kind of stuff that's built to be run like 12 hours a day. And they also have the installation and service capabilities for commercial establishments. Peloton has software, content, community that's absolutely unmatched. You bring those things together, and we've got every reason to be able to win.

Bill, you talked also about a third point I'd raise, which is international. Peloton is only in 6 countries right now, but Precor is in over 60 countries. So that opens up opportunities for Peloton to enter these new markets in ways that build on existing distribution and relationships that we've already got, starting with B2B. So strategically, we're in a great place. It's just an execution challenge from here, and you can already see us executing on this. For example, Precor now provides all the installation and service for Peloton commercial locations, including hotels. Last month, we announced Precor's first slated tread, the Breakaway with a new smarter, more powerful screen and Peloton's first-ever commercial tread initially for hospitality and for multi-dwelling units was launched as part of the new Peloton Pro line. So you add all of this up, I feel great about where we are with our commercial business unit, and I'm confident we're going to be able to bring this together and deliver an industry-leading set of products and solutions on behalf of commercial clients.

James Marsh
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Great. Thanks, Peter. Our second question comes from Christopher in San Francisco, leaderboard named Create SF. Are there any plans in the next 5 years to provide for dividends? Liz, maybe you can handle this one.

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So while this question is specifically asking about offering dividends. It might actually be more helpful if I take a step back and update you all on our current capital structure and talk through our perspective on overall capital allocation strategy. As many of you may recall, in May of 2025, we were approaching a maturity wall, and we successfully completed a $1.35 billion refinancing of our balance sheet. Now following our refinancing, we have generated meaningful free cash flow with $380 million of free cash flow in the last 12 months. And we're really proud of the work that we've done to really strengthen and quickly deleverage our balance sheet with net debt decreasing by $382 million or 49% year-on-year. Our net leverage ratio really reflects the great work that the company has done to get healthy. And the deleveraging story really is a positive for our company, and it should open doors for us to be able to potentially lower interest expense in the future and also invest in strategic uses of our cash.

We do think it's still a bit early to discuss a specific framework for capital allocation, but we do expect that it will become a focus when we pursue a refinancing at the right time. Now there are a few things that I would like to highlight. We talked about this earlier, but we believe there is more cash on our balance sheet than we need to run the business today and that we are a much better credit today than when we last refinanced. Our current priority is continuing to deleverage as we believe this will maximize the optionality for us in the future and reduce our cost of capital.

Now when we think about appropriate range for our gross leverage ratio targets, we're thinking about them in terms of established framework, such as the public ratings framework. Ideally, we would want to align with companies that maintain single -- high single B to BB ratings, and we think a gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range of 2x to 4x is reflective of a good sustainable structure. So with that continued deleveraging, we expect to have more capital allocation alternatives available to us, and those could include things like buying back stock, reinvesting in the business to drive organic growth, pursuing potential inorganic growth opportunities or going back to your original question, offering cash dividends.

James Marsh
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Great. Karen, can you open it up to Q&A at this stage?

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Boone from Citizens Bank.

Andrew Boone
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

I would love to just ask about the recall. Can you guys compare this to the initial recall and just help us understand why those 2 recalls weren't combined?

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

Sure, Andrew. I'll cover that. This is Peter. As I'm sure you can imagine, decisions around recalls are really complicated and depend on a lot of factors. But what I can say is that the Original Series Bike and the Original Series Bike+ are different models and they're physically different pieces of equipment. And at the time of the bike seat post recall, there were no incidents. There was 0 incidents relating to the Bike+.

Andrew Boone
Citizens JMP Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I'd love to understand if there are any derivative impacts from the recall around the business, the brand. Can you guys, again, compare this to the previous recall? Just help us to understand if there are any ripples that we should be thinking about the broader business?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So I can take this one. So let me just first talk about the cost impact. We talked in our prepared remarks about the $13.5 million accrual that we booked last -- in Q1 and in addition to the $3 million that we accrued in Q4, which is a $16.5 million impact. And we do believe that, that is that we made the appropriate assessments and judgments around sizing that accrual, but estimates are forward-looking and actual results may differ. For subscriptions, which I think is one of the things that you were asking about comparing to the prior recall, based on behaviors from our prior seat post recall that was in May of 2023 and which applied only to our original bike models, our Q2 guidance incorporates a small anticipated headwind to Paid Connected Fitness net churn, and that's driven by elevated subscription pauses.

We expect the majority of these incremental pauses to be on pause in Q3. And so that nets out to a small drag on subscriptions for the year. Now in terms of revenue impact, unlike our prior seat post recall, this recall affects bikes manufactured during a specific period that we no longer sell. And we already have replacement seat post inventory available to begin to fulfill anticipated replacement orders. And the overall revenue impact is expected to be immaterial and is reflected in our full year guidance.

Operator

The next question comes from Arpine Kocharyan from UBS.

Arpine Kocharyan
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I'm going to combine 2 questions into one, if I may. And you alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but you're raising EBITDA and your revenue guidance is unchanged, which tells me that there's no major change in your thinking as it relates to underlying churn assumptions from before you raised pricing. First, is that a correct read? And secondly, if you could talk through your thinking of how you see churn normalizing? I think you saw churn normalizing within 8, 12 months post price increase back in 2022. Could you maybe talk about how your base of subscribers is different today versus '22 kind of emerging from COVID lockdown. On the other hand, you've been targeting maybe segments of the market that have underlying churn a bit higher through your rental program and the secondary market. Just if you could talk through what you see different today would be super helpful.

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Arpine, this is Peter. I'll get us started on this, and then Liz feel free to jump in as always. As Liz said, the impact of the price increase in terms of churn has been in line with our expectations, and we're pleased with how it's going. Just to give you a sense of kind of the timing of the thing, we saw elevated cancellations in the first week or so after the announcement. And that was, as you can imagine, mostly concentrated in the first couple of days, and it was concentrated also in members who were more inactive versus our most active members, as you'd also imagine. And some of those people were likely to cancel at some point anyway. Since then, our churn has mostly moderated back to normal. As we indicated on our remarks here, our churn was actually down in Q1. That was the second quarter in a row that, that had taken place. And so we feel pretty good about the overall churn dynamics associated with the business.

We have an increasingly tenured base of loyal members at this stage. And so if we step back and look at what to expect over the course of the year, the higher cancellations and pauses as a result of the price increase will -- that will manifest as higher churn in Q2. Then we should see an improvement in Q3, especially because we'll be reactivating some of the people who paused rather than canceled in Q2. And if we look at the year overall, we're projecting to see overall flat churn on a percentage basis over the entire year despite the tick up in Q2, and that's based on our confidence in the relationship that we have with our members. Yes, we have a very -- a different composition of our members. We have more people who are on programs like rental, for example, are coming from the secondary market, which tend to have higher churn, but that's offset by the fact that we have more -- much more tenured members and that tenure effect leads to lower churn. So all of those things add up to us feeling the level of confidence we've expressed about churn. Liz, do you want to jump there?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I could just -- I was just going to add a little bit about EBITDA. So our EBITDA for the year, we did -- it reflects the outperformance that we had in Q1 because we are taking it up relative to our prior guidance by about $25 million on the full year basis. And so we outperformed in Q1. And then we do expect to see continued tariff favorability associated with the timing delays and lower rates than we had anticipated when we set our prior guidance. And then we also expect that we will realize some of the cost savings related to our $100 million run rate cost savings plan sooner than we anticipated. So all of those factors are driving some of that improvement in adjusted EBITDA.

Operator

The next question comes from Marni Lysaght from Macquarie Capital.

Marni Lysaght
Macquarie Research

I know you've called out some of the factors driving the free cash flow result. You're talking to the full year as well. But can you -- just when we kind of go through the balance sheet and you're talking about timing benefits, like receivables has come in quite lower relative to sales. And I appreciate inventories are a touch high. You've obviously been potentially preparing new products. So just thinking about some of the working capital nuances feeding into free cash flow trends going into this quarter and how you might think about this current quarter and for the -- and how that ties into the full year?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So in terms of Q1, we certainly exceeded our expectations, which we had thought would be slightly negative, and we had some outperformance, and we talked about tariffs and some of those things as well and our cost savings plan. But we did have about $30 million, which I talked about earlier of benefits from vendor payment timing. And so some of that is related to payment terms, improvements in our payment terms and things like that. So that is probably a bit of what you're seeing. And on a full year basis, I do -- we expect to see that continued favorability and then -- but the timing will reverse in there. So we're taking our free cash flow target up by $50 million, but that is a minimum free cash flow target. Also, I want to make sure that to remind you all of that, we expect to be able to outperform that over the course of the year.

Marni Lysaght
Macquarie Research

Understood. And just kind of, I guess, with new products coming to market, the right way of thinking about inventory?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we are balanced in terms of how we thought about inventory for our new products. Even though it's news to everyone here that we launched them in October, obviously, we have been planning for this for quite a while. And so we had a balance of working down our inventory on our old products, and we're being pretty measured about how much we built up in advance of the holiday season. So we feel pretty good about where we are at, at this point.

Marni Lysaght
Macquarie Research

Okay. That's understood. And just a quick one on -- with Repowered, the kind of like the marketplace platform. How do we think about, I guess, the early progress that had a national rollout over the summer? And would the recalls, would that impact some of the vendors on that?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So on Repowered, we -- again, that's -- it still a relatively new marketplace for us. And -- but we did create it as a way to help facilitate secondary market transactions because we are pretty -- the secondary market is an important entry point for us for price-sensitive customers. Now in terms of the recall, we do have -- we will have -- either we do already or we very well have a process in place to make sure that anyone buying on our Repowered marketplace will have access to a Bike+ seat post, it will be part of kind of the flow that they go through when they purchase a Bike+ through that marketplace.

The next question comes from Shweta Khajuria from Wolfe Research.

Shweta Khajuria
Wolfe Research, LLC

Let me try 2, please. First is, Liz, if you could speak to just the overall demand environment. And as you think about the rest of the quarter and into calendar quarter Q1 post the holidays, how are you -- what are you seeing right now that gives you conviction on demand trends generally, especially in the U.S.? And then my follow-up question is on your commercial opportunity. You kind of talked to this earlier as part of your answer to the first question. Could you please help us frame how big that opportunity could be for you in the, call it, near to midterm? And how are you measuring progress as you tap into that opportunity?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So let me talk a little bit about demand trends that we're seeing. So for the Connected Fitness market overall, our internal estimates when we use third-party sales data do indicate that, that category in the U.S. is still declining year-over-year post the surge that we saw from mid-2020 to mid-fiscal 2022, but the rate of decline has decelerated to low single digits. So we're pretty encouraged by the trajectory it is moving towards. But we do expect to see some continued softness in Connected Fitness equipment demand in the short-to-medium term, and that is incorporated into our full year guidance. It's also worth reminding everyone that we are a large player in the Connected Fitness market segment. So our actions to focus on profitability do have an impact within the segment overall, especially for hardware sales. But in the long term, we do remain bullish on our growth potential as well as growth for that -- for the Connected Fitness category and the fitness and wellness economy overall.

I do want to touch on the overall economy -- fitness and wellness economy because we do see that consumers are placing just a higher value on fitness and wellness. And if you think about that, it's much broader than just Connected Fitness in the framing of cardio fitness for the most part. And while it's not a nearly defined TAM today, there is third-party research overall that sizes, if you think about the entire wellness economy in totality, just within the U.S., at over $2 trillion. And now that's a huge number.

We don't plan to participate in all of those categories that fall within the wellness economy. But we are focusing on moving toward areas beyond connected cardio and toward categories that demonstrate scale and growth and proven results for our members. And you've heard Peter talk about some of these. As we redefine our strategy, our market opportunity becomes much larger than connected cardio fitness. So you can think about cardio Connected Fitness as a big piece of us today, but our intent is to go well beyond that. And some of those categories, we've mentioned them before, but I'll just mention them one more time are in addition to cardio, we've got strength. We've got mental well-being, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery. And we'll continue to talk about these more as we execute on our strategy.

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

And just to cover the commercial side of that equation. The overall gym market in the United States is considerably bigger than the in-home Connected Fitness market. And although our internal analysis suggests that it experienced a bit of a slowdown over the last month or 2, if we look over the last couple of years, it's been continuing to grow. And we've experienced growth from the Precor side of our business. In some ways, I think we should be able to outpace the growth rate of the others due to the strategic benefits that I talked about earlier as well as the fact that we are refocusing on the commercial business unit and on Precor itself and recommitting to our commercial partners in that space.

In terms of the metrics for success there, as you, I think, at this point, know about us overall as a management team, we are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable. And so we are working with the commercial business unit to ensure that the plans that we develop results both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well. And again, we feel really good about that category and in particular, our positioning in the category.

Operator

The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.

Bryan Smilek
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Bryan Smilek on for Doug. Just 2 quick questions. Just thinking about the durability of double-digit sustainable Connected Fitness gross margins, can you just help parse out the drivers between product mix shift, the cost savings, obviously, that you're enacting? And I guess, conversely, but also similarly tied, you mentioned increased marketing spend in 2Q. Can you just shed more color on just overall brand positioning, where you're leaning into in terms of target demographics or service or channels as well for marketing?

Liz Coddington
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So in terms of gross margins, just -- I think your question was really kind of more about like long term and thinking about where we're going with gross margins. So if you look back at Q1, our -- to get to the -- this is Connected Fitness gross margin specifically, was 6.9%. That was negatively impacted by the inventory accrual for Bike+ seat post. And if you exclude that, our gross margin would have been 15.8%, and that's up 660 basis points year-over-year. Now if you look ahead to Q2, we're anticipating Connected Fitness products margin to improve compared to Q1, and that's driven by fixed cost leveraging with seasonally higher hardware sales and favorable mix of higher-margin products. And it's also worth noting that it's our highest quarter for seasonal promotions over the holidays. So even with that, we are expecting margin improvement.

We do anticipate our full year fiscal '26 product Connected Fitness product gross margins to increase year-over-year. And then in terms of a long-term target, you mentioned double digits. Our goal is eventually to be in around the 20s range, and we intend to make progress towards that in the fiscal year. I do want to point out, though, as we've talked about on many prior calls, that we will continue to make trade-offs between gross margin and marketing spend based on the LTV to CAC efficiency that we see. Now Peter, did you want to talk a little bit -- I can talk about marketing.

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

On marketing spend, so for us, Q1 was a particularly low quarter. As Liz sort of intimated, we were sort of finishing up in many cases, the inventory that we had of our products. In fact, we went out of stock on the original bike in September in anticipation of the big launch. So there was no point, for example, in blowing it out on marketing when we knew we were doing great and running out of equipment. But as we look at Q2, we have a lot of messages to convey. And I'm so excited about those messages, right? Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the Cross Training Series is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike.

The introduction of Peloton IQ is it's a new concept, right, what we're trying to do in this space. And there's a lot of education that needs to take place. And of course, we've got all of this additional distribution. So we want to make sure that we actually are driving people into those stores because you got to provide the air cover in order for people to see that. That being said, we are, as always, very careful about our spend and pay close attention to our LTV to CAC and ensuring that we are acquiring members profitably.

So what you will see is an increase in our marketing spend in Q2. There will be a higher percentage of our spend on brand and education than you've seen historically as compared with performance marketing in the early parts of the quarter. And then as we get into the latter parts of the quarter, the holiday season itself provides quite a lot of momentum for us. And we shift over to much more efficient performance marketing, and then you should see that over the -- much of the balance of the year, where we'll basically reap the benefits of some of the investment we made in Q2. But all of that, as you can tell, is included in the guidance that we provided for Q2, which still has considerable profitability. So again, our discipline is something that we take pride in, and that is certainly the case in the marketing area.

James Marsh
Senior VP & Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Peter. Karen, maybe we have time for one more question.

Operator

And the last question comes from Susan Anderson from Canaccord.

Susan Anderson
Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division

I guess maybe just to follow up on all of the additional wellness offerings you guys added to the subscription. Just curious if you've seen an uptick in usage of those services yet. It still may be a little early. And then maybe also if you can give an update on how the new certified refurbished equipment program is going.

Peter Stern
CEO, President & Director

So let me start with the usage point. It's actually been really -- that's been really positive. So we mentioned earlier that we've had 500,000 of our members use Club Peloton already. We're also seeing more people taking workouts from our home screen, and let me explain why that matters. For a lot of our members, they kind of stay with the same old, same old. They go to the classes page, and go to their comfort zone. But when people are taking workouts from the home screen, it means that the recommendations that we're delivering with Peloton IQ are starting to hit home.

We've also seen a meaningful increase in strength workouts. And that's based on both our understanding of the science and what's important to our members in terms of their overall health as well as the personalized programs that we've developed for people who started to set goals around building strength and increasing longevity. The most important point is that if we look at the month of October, every kind of usage on a per member basis is up. And what I mean by that is like whether you're talking about workouts in that month, total workouts or the total workout days or total workout time, all those things are up, whereas historically, we typically see workouts go down from September to October.

So we think our investments, in particular, AI, but also the investments we're making in the community on the software side are making a difference. In terms of the -- I think, Susan, your question was about the Repowered program. When you talked about a certified refurb program. And what I'll note right now is that the Repowered program actually doesn't do certified. It is, by the way, an awesome, awesome idea and one of the things that is certainly in our consideration set to actually provide certification because I think trust in this space is one of the areas that we can help to address.

But so far, what we've been doing is solving a sort of more basic set of problems. One is creating a trusted marketplace to match sellers and buyers locally, but also to be able to give them the option to have a professional come and do the pickup and the delivery so that you don't have to go into somebody else's house if you don't want to or have somebody come into your house if you don't want someone there. So that's been the focus so far for Repowered. It's still early days, but we're seeing from what we're being told, good performance from the partner that we're working with on that program, and it's scaling as we expected. But stay posted for more cool stuff, and thanks for throwing out the idea.

Why don't I close this out at this point with thanks, first of all, for everyone who joined today's call and also some encouragement for you to tune into some fun class moments that we have coming up. After Thanksgiving, we will have a veritable buffet of new live and on-demand classes available, including a live Turkey Burn Ride with Robin Arzón; a live Turkey Burn Run with Kirsten Ferguson; and The Feast, a live full-body strength class with 6 of our strength instructors. And coming soon, Emma Lovewell will release her third installment of her popular Crush Your Core program. And we recently launched a podcast, Move for Life hosted by instructor Matt Wilpers and Dr. Kavita Patel that's focused on longevity and it's available on YouTube. And for the investment professionals and analysts out there, our co-developed collection with the Hospital for Special Surgery on Desk Worker Strength & Mobility was made for you.

With that, we look forward to seeing you on the leaderboard and wish you a happy and healthy holiday season.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Peloton Interactive Q2 2025 earnings call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. James Marsh, head of investor relations.

Please go ahead.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Peloton's second quarter fiscal 2025 conference call. Joining today's call are Peloton Chief Executive Officer and President Peter Stern and Chief Financial Officer Liz Coddington. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities law.

Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. For discussion of material risks and other important factors that could impact our actual results, please refer to our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter, both of which can be found on our investor relations website. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter. I'll now turn it over to Peloton's chief executive officer and president, Peter Stern.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. It is an honor to be here with you. I'd like to start by thanking Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo for their leadership during the past few months, inclusive of the quarter we're reporting on today.

Both have now returned to their focus on board duties having left Peloton stronger than they found it. And for that, we share our deepest gratitude. For me, the opportunity to lead Peloton is a dream come true. Fitness has been an important part of my life dating back to my childhood when my mother was a fitness instructor.

I've personally been a Peloton member since 2016 and like millions of others, I love this category-defining brand. Few companies deliver a product where the more people consume it, the better they feel, that's Peloton. And the wonderful thing is that the healthier our members become the more likely they are to stick around and recommend us to others, which makes our business stronger, too. That's Peloton's virtuous cycle.

The Peloton team has made impressive progress over the last few quarters in putting the company on sound financial footing. Nonetheless, we have a tall hill to climb before we can demonstrate the impact of that virtuous cycle on member and revenue growth. So right now, our primary focus is on executing against and delivering our fiscal '25 financial and operating goals while we prepare to climb that tall hill in fiscal '26 and beyond. We'll share more about longer-term strategy as the calendar year progresses.

But today, I can share my perspective after one month of official duties at Peloton. Achieving the new purpose we've defined for ourselves empowering people to live fit, strong, long, and happy means we need to focus on innovation on new products and experiences that lead to even better outcomes for members, presence in more places, so we can meet members wherever they are. More ways to connect members with Peloton and our uniquely supportive community. And last but certainly not least, improved unit economics and the cost structure that's rightsized for our business.

Like every Peloton workout, this will be part inspiration, part perspiration. There's a lot of research that shows that engaging in multiple fitness disciplines improves member outcomes. While Peloton is best known for our cycling workouts, we're a leader in Strength, too. In Q2, over 2 million unique members completed a Strength training, boot camp, Pilates, or yoga workout.

Strength drove 735 million minutes of workout time in Q2. And in terms of workouts equaled 75% of our total number of cycling workouts. Variety is good not only for our members but also for our business as it drives higher subscription retention. Churn is 60% lower for subscriptions where members engage with two or more disciplines per month versus just one.

On the cardio side, we continue to elevate Tread, thanks to our marketing efforts, which enabled us to exceed our Tread portfolio sales goals and achieve higher new subscription attach rates on Tread and Tread+ sales year over year in Q2. And with the release of our 10K training program in Q2, Peloton now offers training for all major race distances. And already over 300,000 members have trained for a running race with Peloton. We're also seeing the positive impact of innovative new software features like Pace Targets, which offer running instruction with personalized intensity levels rather than treadmill speed.

Nearly 60% of our members who take instructor-led running workouts on our Tread products are using Pace Targets, and our members running paces are improving as a result. Another way to improve our business is to meet members in more places. For example, at the gym. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app offering non-class strength training programs with audio guidance from expert coaches and a custom workout generator.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

drove more Bike+ unit sales than any other third-party retail partner, enabling us to meet many new members at a retailer they trust. And we remain focused on meeting more new members across the globe. We are encouraged by the performance of international hardware sales in Q2 alongside our continued growth in Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions from international markets. Turning to the connections between Peloton's members with the company and with each other.

As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance. So we are focused on deepening the connections our 6 million members have with each other and with Peloton. In September, we launched Teams, which enables members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch.

Then in November, we hosted the 11th annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Burn, where over 50,000 members worked out together live. This year's Turkey Burn also brought the Feast, our first Thanksgiving live Strength class which became the largest live Strength class in Peloton's history. One of the best ways to measure the strength of our members' connection to Peloton is through member satisfaction and retention. In Q2, we made meaningful improvements in member happiness with Net Promoter Scores improving across all our Bike and Tread products to over 70.

As someone who has spent many years in consumer check and services businesses, I can tell you that this level of member love puts us in truly rarefied air. Part of the reason for this was improvements in the responsiveness and quality of our member support. Our Member Support Satisfaction Score was 4.3 on a scale of one to five, up from 4.2 last quarter and meaningfully higher than the 3.1 in Q2 of fiscal '24. From a retention standpoint, we continue to benefit from exceptionally low churn rates with average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn of 1.4% in Q2.

Liz will discuss our second quarter financials in more detail but I want to take a beat on unit economics and rightsizing our costs because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth. During this important holiday quarter, we achieved a 12.9% Connected Fitness Products gross margin, reaching double digits for the first time in over three years by selling a favorable mix of premium price products and demonstrating real discipline by aligning our discounts with the margins of our products. On the cost side, the team has made great progress. We are on track to exceed $200 million of run-rate cost savings by the end of fiscal '25, which was the target announced in our May '24 restructuring plan, as well as additional operating expense efficiencies, including reduced media spend.

The progress made so far shows in our profitability where we achieved meaningful improvements in Q2. Both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow increased roughly $140 million year over year. This enabled us to make meaningful progress deleveraging our balance sheet with net debt decreasing over $280 million or 30% year over year. All this is to say that while we are working on our long-term growth strategy, for fiscal '26 and beyond, our financial goals for fiscal '25 and continued discipline toward improving gross margins, reducing operating costs, and deleveraging our balance sheet are and will remain top priorities for me.

Now I'll turn it over to Liz to discuss our Q2 results.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. We are pleased with our second quarter results as we exceeded our guidance on key metrics and continued to make meaningful progress improving unit economics and profitability. We also made progress on our marketing objectives by improving LTV to CAC year over year and elevating Tread with Target audiences. We ended the quarter with 2.88 million Paid Connected Fitness subscription reflecting a net decrease of 21,000 in the quarter.

This exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 19,000 subscriptions. Outperformance was driven by favorable net churn, partially offset by lower growth additions. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness subscription churn was 1.4%. This reflects a 50-basis-point improvement quarter over quarter, exceeding internal expectations for seasonally lower churn in Q2.

Net churn was positively impacted by lower-than-expected subscription cancellations, lower subscription pauses and higher reactivation. Reactivation performance was positively impacted by marketing efforts targeting churned subscriptions. Q2 net churn of 1.4% also reflects an increase of 20 basis points year over year as the benefit from higher reactivation was offset by two main factors. First, in Q2 fiscal 2024, we had a one-time benefit from fewer net pauses as a result of a shift toward shorter pause length options.

Second, we continue to see a slight headwind to churn as a result of subscription mix shift toward the secondary market, which has a higher churn profile than subscriptions that purchase their hardware directly from us or our channel partners. Favorable churn was partially offset by lower gross additions due to slightly lower hardware unit sales, a higher mix of Tread portfolio sales, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products, and longer delivery times for Tread+ units that delayed subscription activations until Q3. Secondary market activations were in line with internal expectations and represented roughly 40% of total gross additions in the quarter. We ended the second quarter with 579,000 Paid App subscriptions inclusive of Strength+ subscription, reflecting a net decrease of 4,000 in the quarter.

This result exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 9,000. Total revenue was $674 million in the second quarter, comprising $253 million of Connected Fitness Products revenue, a decrease of $66 million or 21% year over year, and $421 million of Subscription Revenue, a decrease of $4 million or 1% year over year. Total revenue was $14 million above the high end of our $640 million to $660 million guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenue from both segments. The holiday season is a critical period for Connected Fitness products revenue as Q2 has historically represented over 40% of annual hardware unit sales.

Connected Fitness products revenue exceeded expectation from higher-than-expected premium-priced hardware sales, predominantly Tread and Tread+, partly offset by slight underperformance in overall unit sales. Due to higher-than-expected Tread+ sales, we faced inventory constraints that temporarily led to longer delivery times, delaying some Tread+ deliveries and associated connected fitness product revenue recognition to the third quarter. We also observed higher-than-expected sales for our low-priced refurbished bike. Offsetting the higher sales of our Tread and Refurbished Bike products, we observed lower sales from the midrange price point, specifically the original Bike.

Subscription revenue was higher than expected as a result of higher Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions. Seasonally higher hardware sales in the second quarter is reflected in the revenue mix of 38% Connected Fitness products revenue and 62% subscription revenue. From a sales channel perspective, third-party retail sales were lower than we expected in Q2, which we believe was partly due to our decision to offer lower promotional discounts on the original Bike compared to last year in accordance with our effort to increase hardware margins. Our holiday performance reflects the continued progress we've made in evolving our marketing strategy.

In November, we launched our Find Your Power campaign, featuring J.J. and T.J. Watt. This campaign targeted men and highlighted Tread and Strength products with media rated on live sports.

This campaign resonated well with men. In Q2, 42% of Connected Fitness Subscription gross additions were men, a 280-basis-point increase quarter over quarter and 240 basis points increase year over year. In addition to advertising more toward men, our marketing efforts were also focused on demonstrating the full value of the Peloton membership through better education of our extensive offerings. Among the Latine and core female audiences exposed to our holiday campaign, we observed a lift in awareness of non-cycling modalities like walking, running, yoga, and high-intensity interval training.

We also saw an increased in the Latine audience that would consider using Peloton, which is a leading indicator of future intent to purchase. Alongside reaching new audiences and introducing additional disciplines to our members, we continue to make progress on improving our marketing efficiency which we measure from a lens of our LTV to CAC ratio. While our LTV to CAC remains in the range of one to two times, we have made progress year over year toward our target to reach at least two times and ideally closer to three times. Our Q2 LTV to CAC was roughly 15% higher than Q2 fiscal 2024.

Total gross profit was $318 million in Q2, an increase of $19 million or 6% year over year. Total gross margin was 47.2%, 70 basis points above our guidance due to favorable Connected Fitness product gross margin and favorable subscription gross margin, partially offset by revenue mix shift for our Connected Fitness products segment. Connected Fitness products gross margin was 12.9%, up 860 basis points year over year, primarily driven by a mix shift toward higher-margin products, lower warehousing and transportation-related costs and a reduction in inventory reserves. Subscription gross margin was 67.9%, up 60 basis points year over year.

Total operating expenses, including restructuring and impairment expenses, were $364 million in the second quarter, a $122 million or 25% reduction year over year, reflecting the progress we've made thus far toward rightsizing our cost structure. We are tracking ahead of our cost savings targets for fiscal 2025. Sales and marketing expense was $153 million, a decrease of $78 million or 34% year over year, primarily from a 38% decrease in advertising and marketing spend and lower personnel-related expenses. General and administrative expense was $131 million, a decrease of $29 million or 18% year over year, primarily driven by a decrease in settlement costs, professional services fees, and personnel-related expenses.

Research and development expenses were $60 million, a decrease of $20 million or 25% year over year, primarily driven by lower employee related and contractor expenses. In Q2, we recognized $20 million of impairment and restructuring expenses, of which $17 million was noncash. The noncash charges were primarily related to asset write-downs in relation to retail showroom exits. The cash charges consisted of $3 million of severance and other exit and disposal costs as we continue executing on our restructuring efforts.

Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the second quarter, which was $28 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $140 million improvement year over year. We generated $106 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, an improvement of $95 million quarter over quarter and $143 million year over year, and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $829 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $107 million quarter over quarter. We continue to make progress toward deleveraging our balance sheet as net debt reduced $281 million or 30% year over year.

Overall, our second quarter performance reflects our continued progress in rearchitecting our cost structure, while maintaining our leadership position within the Connected Fitness category. It also reflects the strength of our high retention, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2025. Following our outperformance in Q2 relative to our previous guidance, we are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance midpoint across our key metrics, including ending Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions, total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA.

We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for paid Connected Fitness subscriptions by 55,000 at the midpoint to a narrower range of $2.75 million to $2.79 million. This increase reflects our expectations for lower net churn, due to the continued favorability across subscription cancellations, pauses, and reactivation, partly offset by our expectations for lower growth additions, due to lower hardware sales and mix shift into Tread products, which have lower new subscription attachment rates than our Bike products. Our guidance for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.85 million to 2.87 million, reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales trends following the holiday season, and for our average net monthly paid Connected Fitness subscription churn rate to remain relatively in line with the second quarter.

Our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000 remains unchanged. Our outlook for third quarter fiscal 2025 ending paid app subscriptions is 560,000 to 580,000. Our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total revenue of $2.43 billion to $2.48 billion, reflects a narrower range and an increase of $5 million at the midpoint. This reflects our expectations for favorable subscription revenue from higher paid Connected Fitness subscription and favorable Connected Fitness products revenue from higher trend portfolio sales, partly offset by lower Bike portfolio sales.

Q3 revenue guidance of $605 million to $625 million reflects our expectations for seasonally lower hardware sales compared to the second quarter. We are increasing our full-year fiscal 2025 outlook for total gross margin to 50% reflecting a 100-basis-point increase from prior guidance from expected favorability in Connected Fitness Product segment gross margin and higher subscription segment gross margin, as well as a slight revenue mix shift toward our subscription segment. Our third quarter total gross margin guidance of 50% reflects an expected sequential increase in gross margin of 280 basis points as a result of the seasonal mix shift toward our subscription segment in the third quarter. We are raising our full-year fiscal 2025 guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million to the range of $300 million to $350 million, which reflects our expectations for continued improvements in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion and continued operating cost savings.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

Before we open for Q&A, I'd like to hand it back to Peter to talk about what makes Peloton so special and gives us such optimism for the future.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Liz. You and the team should be proud of the work you all accomplished in Q2. There are lots of companies that make fitness equipment, dozens of fitness apps, countless trainers, but there is only one Peloton. That's because we combine the best hardware, the best software, and the best human coaches with the world's most supportive community.

That's our magic formula. And when we get it right, we are unstoppable. And as I just discussed, winning is about focusing on what matters most, improving outcomes for our members, meeting them in more places, and deepening the connections between them and Peloton, as well as with each other. And that will take operational excellence and financial discipline, attention to the details that raise our performance for members and as a business.

This will be hard work. As Jess Sims said, "Never easy, always worth it." With the energy, momentum, and excitement I've seen from Peloton team members in the few short weeks since I started. I am more optimistic than ever about the future of Peloton. With that, Liz and I are delighted to answer your questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator

Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO. Your line is open.

Simeon Siegel -- Analyst

Thanks. Hey, everyone. I was curious how you're thinking about the path to growth versus the ongoing improvement in profits. I know it's still early days for you, but just curious if you have any thoughts on any timeline you'd want to share in terms of your views as you dig in.

And then just as a follow-up, I'm not sure if this is for you or for Liz, but you guys have been doing such a nice job in improving profitability in recent quarters. Could you share any thoughts on continuing that profitability improvement if and when you do decide to start investing for growth? Thanks.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Simeon, for the warm welcome. As you know, I've been at Peloton for just over a month. So I'm not ready to talk about when or the details of how we plan to turn the business back to top-line growth. But I can tell you what we're doing to earn the right to grow, share my belief that we will, and suggest where to look when we do.

So first, we're setting the stage to be able to grow while ensuring we can deliver meaningful adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by rightsizing our expenses, which are down 25% year over year in Q2, improving our equipment gross margins, which are back up to double digits for the first time in years and increasing our LTV to CAC ratio, which has improved about 15% year over year. And doing all this is reducing our net debt and our leverage ratios, which means that we'll have the financial capacity that we need to make investments that have strong returns. But I don't want to leave you hanging on the growth question. So I'll just sort of tell you where to look and the levers.

So there are three areas. One, we're looking to improve member outcomes through innovation on new products and services. And if we get that right, then we have the potential to pull all three levers of growing members, growing revenue per member, and increasing member lifetimes. The second is meeting members in more places, and that also allows us to pull the levers of meeting -- of growing members and revenue per member.

And then third is deepening the connection that we have with our existing members, which, in particular, has the potential to lengthen the lifetimes that we have with our members, which are already impressively long. So again, no specifics today, but that's where to look.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. And I'll take the question about the continuing profitability improvement. As you just heard us say a few minutes ago, we did just raise our full-year adjusted EBITDA target for FY '25 by $60 million. And so that is reflecting continued improvements in profitability that we expect largely due to our gross margin expansion that we talked about, as well as continued operating expense savings.

We are on track to exceed our $200 million annualized run rate cost savings plan by the end of fiscal '25 that we committed to in our restructuring plan back in May of 2024. And then on top of that, as we continue to talk about, we are seeing upside from savings in media, which we also expect to be down materially year over year for the remainder of FY '25. And while we're pleased with this progress that we've made, we do see further opportunities for cost optimizations, and we built a culture of cost discipline into our company. We know that our opex as a percent of revenue is still too high overall for the long term and especially that's true within our G&A area.

And we do see multiple opportunities to rightsize it. A couple of examples include things like we still have a lot of tech debt where we're continuing to solve technology gaps inefficiently with manual work. We're going to work to eliminate that. And then another example would be reducing our corporate real estate expenses over time as we see opportunities to do that.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Simeon. Operator, next question, please.

Operator

One moment, please. And that will come from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst

Thanks a ton for taking my questions. I have two, please. Well, so you're starting to make progress on deleveraging. Can you please highlight some of the milestones on your plan, deleveraging plan from here, and maybe some of the tangible and intangible benefits of deleveraging? And then the follow-up question is on the tariffs.

Do you expect to see any meaningful impact from tariffs if levied on your P&L? Thank you.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Shweta. I'll start with the question on deleveraging. So the increase to our minimum free cash flow target to at least $200 million in fiscal '25. That, first of all, reflects this -- a tremendous improvement of over $200 million year over year.

And then if you go back to FY '23 it's over $670 million improvement. And that improving free cash flow has really enabled us to deleverage and our reduction in net debt, we talked about it earlier, of $285 million or 30% year over year in Q2. Now if you pair that lower net debt with growing trailing adjusted EBITDA, that's helping our reported leverage ratio to decline from seven times in Q1 to 2.7 times in Q2. Now in terms of the tangible benefits of that, the improvement to our leverage ratio has enabled us to achieve a first lien net leverage ratio below five times and that is resulting now in a 50-basis-point step down on our term loans, and that equates to roughly $5 million of annualized interest expense savings going forward as long as we continue to hit that threshold each quarter.

Now on the intangible side, the improvements that we're making to our balance sheet are lowering risk. They're positioning us well for future sustainable and profitable growth. And over time, we do expect this will lower our cost of capital, and that will give us more optionality around capital allocation.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Why don't I jump in for a moment on the tariff part of your question, Shweta, and then I'll pass it back to Liz for a bit more detail? As I'm sure you all know the questions around tariffs really represent a rapidly moving target. And so we're closely monitoring it I'm sure, alongside all of you. The good news here is that no Peloton branded hardware products are subject to the tariffs from China or if they were to reemerge from Mexico or Canada. And of course, most of our revenues come from subscriptions.

Liz can provide a little more color here.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So while the tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada are currently paused, if all of the tariffs went into effect at the current proposed tariff rates, we would expect to see roughly 1% impact to our Connected Fitness products, and that's mainly related to Peloton Apparel and Precor. And that estimate also assumes no mitigation. For China only, our unmitigated impact is well under 1% of Connected Fitness COGS.

Shweta Khajuria -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Liz.

One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Curtis Nagle -- Analyst

I wanted to focus on the free cash flow, just what drove the outperformance in 2Q? And then on the big raise for the full year, assuming that's mostly just the incremental flow-through on the higher EBITDA, maybe some working capital efficiencies? Could we -- I guess that will be the first question if you go through that. And I have a follow-up.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So let me talk a little bit through our free cash flow. So our Q2 free cash flow of $106 million, that did exceed our internal expectations. And some of the benefits that we saw were permanent and some of them are timing.

On the timing front, we saw a significant amount of favorability associated with the timing of invoices for music and media vendors that we do expect to pay in Q3 and our outperformance -- on the permanent side, our outperformance in Q2 adjusted EBITDA also benefited free cash flow. And so that outperformance was driven by favorable revenue and faster-than-expected operating expense reductions as we've talked about earlier. And then again, I also mentioned that we raised our guidance midpoint for adjusted EBITDA by $60 million and we expect most of that to flow through to free cash flow. We also did see a benefit in net working capital from reducing inventory production levels.

Previously, when we had set guidance last quarter, there was some uncertainty around how much we could optimize production. And so our full-year guidance or target of at least $200 million of free cash flow reflects those impacted inventory production improvement to net working capital and then also that faster-than-expected operating expense savings. I do want to point out that the $200 million minimum free flow target which implies roughly $87 million in free cash flow in the second half of FY '25, that's our minimum expectation. Our goal is to achieve more than this.

Curtis Nagle -- Analyst

Awesome. Good to hear. Peter, maybe a question for you, just churn numbers were certainly encouraging. I guess, just in terms of maybe a little bit more what's driving it? I mean, it sounds like it's results of some of these engagement efforts maybe you're seeing a leveling off across the subbase more generally.

Just digging into that and then just what's assumed in the guidance, maybe a little more specifically, I think churn is lower. But yes, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Curtis, thanks for asking. I like to talk about our churn because we've -- our subscription business continues to show remarkable consistency and resilience with that exceptionally low average net monthly churn rate of 1.4% for Connected Fitness subscriptions. So what's going on here? One, like all the subscription businesses I've ever seen, there's a tenure effect here. We have a great deal of long-standing and highly loyal members.

And so with the passage of time, that benefits our churn. The second thing is looking at engagements. Peloton is that rare brand that makes you healthier the more you use it. And so one of our goals is to get more people using our product more and we're pleased to see here some growth in our engagement levels in terms of the average monthly workout time for ending Connected Fitness subscription if we look at that on a year-over-year basis.

So we've got a healthy customer base. We've got healthy usage. As I mentioned earlier, we have strong NPS scores, and that all adds up to healthy churn. Liz maybe you want to provide a little more color?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

I can provide a little bit more color on the outlook. I think you were asking a little bit more. We're not -- we don't guide specifically to churn, but we can -- I can tell you that in Q3, we do expect our average month -- net monthly paid Connected Fitness churn rate to remain relatively in line with Q2. And then just on a full-year basis, we do continue to expect our churn rate to increase modestly year-over-over.

And as we've talked about before, we do continue to see a mix shift of our subscriptions into the secondary market, which has a lower retention rate compared to subscriptions where customers purchase their fitness hardware directly from us. And then we have talked about this one-time subscription on pause benefit in fiscal '24 that won't repeat. And those are creating a slight headwind for us. And that's partially offset by all the great work our marketing team is doing to reactivate lapsed subscription.

Curtis Nagle -- Analyst

Helpful. Thank you.

Operator

One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Your line is open.

Arpine Kocharyan -- Analyst

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, welcome to Peloton. Great to hear you on the call.

You talked a lot about improving churn. I was wondering, is it fair to assume that this better-than-expected churn, which is probably not as much of a surprise to you as to us, given the efforts you've taken to get there? My question is, how should we think about potential price increases in light of improving churn? It seems like you feel better about churn today than you did three months ago. First, is that a fair assumption? Second, how should we think about sort of price increases in the subscription business in light of improving churn? Then I have a quick follow-up.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Arpine, thanks for the question. And we obviously -- we feel good about the churn that we just reported, and Liz just talked you through a little bit about how we're thinking about it for the rest of the year. With regard to pricing, to state the obvious, pricing is a powerful lever with every change up or down, essentially dropping straight to the bottom line. So we're taking a hard look at pricing alongside everything else in our business.

As a reminder, in Q1, we took steps to improve our unit economics by taking up the price of our rower in North America, and we also raised prices for Bike and Bike+ in our international markets. This holiday season, we also improved our hardware unit economics by reducing the number of days that we were on promotion and by structuring our promotional strategy to better align with the margin profile of our products. So all of that added up to greater discipline, as well as some terrific learning opportunities for us around pricing. I think a question that might be in everybody's mind is around subscription pricing, and we know how important subscription pricing is to our members, as well as to the performance of the business, and we won't take any actions there lightly.

So beyond what I've shared so far, that's about all we have to say today, but we'll share more about pricing when we're ready to.

Arpine Kocharyan -- Analyst

Wonderful. Great. Peter, I was wondering if you could share your initial impression of where your see low-hanging fruit in terms of further cost optimization. Do you feel that that's first in hardware COGS versus more in sort of opex and the obvious sort of G&A that you've talked about before in terms of being higher than it's supposed to be? Where do you see that low-hanging fruit as you sort of look at the business with fresh eyes?

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Let's talk a little bit about this before. I think the important thing for us to note is that we're being very aggressive with regard to costs. And we are on track to deliver the $200 million in expense savings that we laid out just a few months ago. And you can see that reflected in the results that we reported today.

We also think that there are some opportunities, both in the IT space, both as an enabler of reducing manual effort from our employees, as well as an area that we're looking at are things like IT licenses. Liz shared with you the work that we're doing on reducing our corporate real estate expense as well. And that does feel like relatively low-hanging fruit, although those savings do take time to materialize due to our contractual commitments. So we're absolutely planning on achieving those savings, but they'll materialize when it makes sense.

In terms of free cash flow, you heard Liz's good news about the $5 million step down in our interest expense, that's real money. And that's low-hanging fruit that it might not have felt low hanging a year ago. But from where we are right now, that's an immediate benefit that the team has achieved due to their impressive work on deleveraging.

Arpine Kocharyan -- Analyst

Thank you very much.

Operator

One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Lane Czura with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Eric Sheridan -- Analyst

Hi. This is Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Peter, I had a quick question on brand versus direct marketing investments and generating end demand. How do you think about the mix of those marketing investments over the medium to long term and where there could potentially be a higher return on marketing spend as you think about deploying that -- those growth investments against your platform goals?

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Eric. The fitness category, in particular, is a category where you do have to remind people, to get back into the market and do the right thing for themselves. So I don't think you can anticipate that this is a business where we're suddenly going to be able to do away with all brand marketing spend. And I think we've demonstrated the ability to do some brand marketing, for example, our Watt Brothers advertising and move the needles that we intended and promised to move, for example, with the increased uptake that we saw of our products by men.

That being said, we recognize that brand marketing is more difficult to measure and justify than performance marketing. So what does that mean? With regard to brand marketing, Lauren and our team are being really disciplined about doing things like media mix modeling and hold out areas for us to try to determine the real impact of our brand marketing spend, and know which half works versus which half doesn't work so that we can be as efficient as possible with that. Secondly, we are doing as much of our marketing spend in the performance category where it's highly measurable as we possibly can. And the good news there is that when you look at the sum total of our marketing spend, we're getting more effective and more efficient.

Our reduction in marketing spend in Q2 exceeded the reduction in our Connected Fitness sales by a meaningful amount. And that also resulted in improvement in our LTV to CAC ratio. Again, not where we want it to be long term, but material progress toward our goal of exceeding a ratio of 2:1. So we're getting better.

We're putting in place the tools and the discipline to achieve further improvements. And I think you'll see us balance performance and brand marketing in a thoughtful way going forward.

Eric Sheridan -- Analyst

Great.

James Milton Marsh -- Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Eric. Operator, we have time for one more question.

Operator

And our final question will come from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Lee Horowitz -- Analyst

Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. Maybe, Peter, we appreciate the growth plans for '26 and beyond are still in the works. Can you maybe talk at a high level as to what you see as the most obvious levers you can pull in order to stabilize sort of the gross addition declines that you've seen worsened to start off the calendar year? And one follow-up to Liz, if I could.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Sure. Lee, the most important thing for us to do in the near term is to super serve the members that we have. And we've made real progress on that. If you look at the improvement, for example, in our MSAT score which year over year -- remember, this is a five-point scale, has gone up from 3.1 to 4.3.

And we have a higher target than that going forward. That's a situation where we're doing everything we can to ensure that every new customer, in particular, loves us as much as the ones that we've retained in the past. We're also working really hard in the near term to launch new capabilities that add value to our existing members. So as we mentioned in the remarks, when we see members who are engaging in two or more disciplines, we have a 60% reduction in our churn rate.

So we're working really hard to get people to, for example, embrace the Strength modality which we know, based on a lot of research is a terrific addition to a cardio program. These things, I think, are the lowest-hanging fruit in the next few months for us to continue to retain that customer base that we worked so hard to acquire. Liz, do you want to add anything?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

No. The only thing that I would say is, to your point, is about retaining the subscribers that we have and then also for those that are joining us new, making sure that they get off to a really great start and are able to engage because we do know that if they engage early that that will predict that they will be a subscriber for a longer period of time. So that would also manifest in lower churn for the subscriber who are joining us as new gross additions.

Lee Horowitz -- Analyst

Really helpful. And maybe one just follow-up on Connected Fitness gross profit, gross margin sort of reaching that double-digit sort of milestone for the first time is a great hurdle to clear, but we think that you still are always away from where you think this can go over time. Any context as to sort of where you see the upper band on Connected Fitness product gross margin and the levers you have there to sort of pull those higher going forward?

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So our improvements in Connected Fitness gross margin are due to -- there's multiple dimensions to that. Some of that is mixed into some of our more premium products that do have a higher gross margin and then some of that is also just being more optimized in how we offer discounts. And then we've also made some pricing changes.

So we can continue to pull all of those levers over time. And we do expect our gross margins can -- that they can continue to expand. I'm not going to give you a specific target for that, but we know that there is more opportunity to expand them over time. And we do expect for the remainder just to clarify, for Q3 and the full year for fiscal '25, at least, we do expect to maintain double-digit Connected Fitness product gross margins primarily because we are shifting toward those higher-margin products and being really disciplined about our promotions.

Lee Horowitz -- Analyst

Great.

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Stern for any closing remarks.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

So before we end the call, I want to acknowledge that Peloton has a very special base of investors because many of you are also our enthusiastic members. And in addition to being the CEO, I'm also an enthusiastic member. So let me leave you with a few thoughts that bridge the two ways we relate to Peloton. I talked earlier about improving member outcomes.

One of the ways we're doing this is by providing personalized coaching. If you haven't already tried a Power Zone ride, Pace Targets on Tread, or the Personalized Plans feature we released last week, please do so. These are already delivering impact for our members, and they're a taste of the future. And if you haven't already tried a Peloton strength, boot camp, Pilates, or yoga class, there's no time like the present.

I also talked about meeting members in more places. There are lots of ways that Peloton shows up in the physical world, but one way that I'm excited about this month is in the virtual one: our appearance in Marvel Studios, Captain America: Brave New World in theaters next Friday. And while you wait for that, keep an eye out for some special workouts to help you get fit like a superhero. Finally, I talked about making members for life and the importance of connecting our members with each other.

We launched public teams last week, and I'd encourage every one of you to go on our app and join one. And if you're an analyst, please join James' Team, Together We Go Long, because we know that being part of a supportive community helps people establish and stay with healthy routines. OK. You have your assignments.

Thank you for joining today's call, and I'll see you on the leaderboard.

## MODEL ✨

I will now review the analysis files to identify content for additional specialized pages. Based on the "Peter Stern Era" and "Restructuring Timeline" documents, I will create two new pages: `innovation.html` (focusing on the new product roadmap and AI strategy) and `restructuring.html` (providing a visual timeline of the 2022-2025 operational shifts).

First, I'll update the navigation in `index.html` to reflect the expanded site structure.

## MODEL ✨

The Peloton Business Intelligence Dashboard is now complete and published to GitHub.

### Dashboard Overview
The site has been implemented as a multi-page interactive application:
1.  **[Turnaround Overview (index.html)](https://obriedan.github.io/peloton-presentation/index.html):** Visualizes the core financial metrics (Revenue, EBITDA, FCF), the Execution Scorecard (Targets vs. Actuals), and Subscriber Health. Features an integrated **Source Material Viewer** side panel.
2.  **[Product Innovation (innovation.html)](https://obriedan.github.io/peloton-presentation/innovation.html):** Details the "Peter Stern Era" strategy, the Cross Training Series, and the AI-driven Peloton IQ roadmap.
3.  **[Restructuring Roadmap (restructuring.html)](https://obriedan.github.io/peloton-presentation/restructuring.html):** A visual timeline of the operational shift from 2022 to 2025, mapping the transition from vertical integration to an asset-light model.
4.  **[Risk Post-Mortem (post-mortem.html)](https://obriedan.github.io/peloton-presentation/post-mortem.html):** Analyzes the "Five Strategic Failures" identified by management and the structural "fixes" implemented during the turnaround.

### Technical Implementation
- **Visuals:** Powered by Chart.js with a "Financial Terminal" dark-mode aesthetic.
- **Data:** Centralized in `js/data.js` for easy updates.
