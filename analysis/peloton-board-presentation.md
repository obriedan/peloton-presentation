# SLIDE 1: From Crisis to Cash Flow — The Turnaround Story

## **Key Message**
Peloton has successfully completed a strategic pivot from a hardware-centric, vertically integrated business model to an asset-light, subscription-focused operation — transforming from burning $2.4B in cash (FY22) to generating $324M in free cash flow (FY25). The structural flaw has been addressed; the question is now whether this smaller, leaner company can return to growth.

---

### Supporting Points

**1. The Scale of the Collapse**
| Metric | FY21 Peak | FY25 | Change |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $4.02B | $2.49B | **-38%** |
| Hardware Revenue | $3.15B | $817M | **-74%** |
| Subscription Revenue | $872M | $1.67B | **+92%** |
| Adjusted EBITDA | +$254M | +$404M | +59%* |
| Free Cash Flow | -$492M | +$324M | **+$816M swing** |

*Note: FY22 EBITDA was -$983M, making the true recovery a $1.4B improvement

**2. The Root Cause Was Structural, Not Just Cyclical**
Management identified five causal factors, but the underlying structural flaw was Peloton's vertically integrated operating model (owned manufacturing, owned logistics, owned retail) which created massive fixed costs that couldn't flex when post-pandemic demand collapsed.

| What Broke | Impact | Restructuring Response |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| Owned manufacturing | Overcapacity, inventory write-downs | Exited ALL owned manufacturing; partnered with Rexon |
| Owned logistics | High fixed costs, regional complexity | Shifted to 3PL nationwide |
| 135 retail showrooms | Unsustainable lease obligations | Closed most; pivoted to 10 micro-stores + third-party retail |
| Overstaffed organization | $983M negative EBITDA (FY22) | Reduced headcount from peak to 2,656 (-26% since FY23) |

**3. Revenue Mix Transformation**
The business model has fundamentally shifted:
- FY21: Hardware = 78% of revenue, Subscriptions = 22%
- FY25: Hardware = 33% of revenue, Subscriptions = **67%**

This is not shrinkage—it's transformation. Subscription gross margins (~69%) are 5x hardware margins (~13.6%), meaning profitability improved even as revenue declined.

**4. Cash Position Stabilized**
- FY22: Consumed $2.36B in cash (negative FCF + restructuring charges)
- FY25: Generated $324M in free cash flow
- $722M unrestricted cash on hand
- On track to pay down ~$200M convertible notes (Feb 2026)

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Two-panel chart:**
- **Left panel**: Stacked bar chart showing revenue composition shift (FY21 → FY25) with hardware declining and subscriptions growing as proportion
- **Right panel**: Waterfall chart showing the free cash flow bridge from -$2.36B (FY22) to +$324M (FY25), with restructuring savings and margin improvement as the key drivers

---

### Actionable Insight

> **The restructuring addressed the root cause (fixed-cost vertical integration) rather than just treating symptoms.** However, this was a *survival* strategy, not a *growth* strategy. The company is now right-sized for a ~2.8M subscriber base generating ~$2.5B in revenue. 
>
> **Board Action Required**: Define the strategic intent — is Peloton a "harvest" business (maximize cash flow from existing base) or a "growth" business (reinvest to expand)? Current trajectory supports the former; Peter Stern's initiatives signal ambition for the latter. These require different capital allocation frameworks and management incentives.

---

### Speaker Notes

Peloton's crisis was fundamentally different from a typical demand shock. When pandemic tailwinds reversed in late 2021, the company discovered that its vertically integrated model — which had been a competitive advantage during hyper-growth — had become an existential threat. Unlike competitors who outsourced manufacturing and logistics, Peloton owned factories, warehouses, delivery fleets, and 135 retail showrooms. When revenue fell 38% from peak, these fixed costs couldn't flex, resulting in nearly $3 billion in losses over FY22-FY23.

The restructuring response was appropriately aggressive. By exiting all owned manufacturing (partnering with Rexon), shifting to third-party logistics, and closing most retail showrooms, management converted the cost structure from predominantly fixed to predominantly variable. This structural change is permanent and positions the company to remain profitable even if the subscriber base continues to erode modestly.

However, the board should recognize that this turnaround was achieved through contraction, not innovation. The company is significantly smaller than at its peak, and the current profitability depends on maintaining the existing subscriber base rather than growing it. The question facing the board is whether this is the steady state, or whether the new management team can reignite growth from this stabilized foundation.

# SLIDE 2: Execution Scorecard — Management Credibility Assessment

## **Key Message**
Management has established a consistent track record of beating guidance and raising targets over the past five quarters, earning credibility on operational execution. Cost discipline is a GREEN light; subscriber growth is RED. The board should trust near-term profitability guidance but apply skepticism to any growth projections until proven.

---

### Targets vs. Actuals: The Pattern of Beats

**FY25 Guidance Evolution (Quarterly)**
| Quarter | Initial Target | Final Result | Performance |

| FY25 FCF | $75M (Aug 2024) → $200M (Feb 2025) | **$324M** | Beat revised target by **62%** |
| FY25 Gross Margin | 47% (Aug 2024) | **50.9%** | Beat by **390 bps** |
| FY25 Revenue | $2.43-2.48B | **$2.49B** | Within range |
| FY25 Subscribers | 2.68-2.75M → 2.75-2.79M | **2.80M** | Beat revised target |

**Q1 FY26 Performance vs. Guidance (Nov 2025)**
| Metric | Guidance | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | $540-545M | **$551M** | Beat by $6M |
| Subscribers | 2.71-2.73M | **2.732M** | Beat by 2K |
| Adj. EBITDA | $90-100M | **$118M** | Beat by **$18M** |
| Free Cash Flow | Slightly negative | **+$67M** | Massive beat |
| Gross Margin | 52% | 51.5% | **Miss** (-50bps)* |

*Miss attributable to $13.5M one-time Bike+ seat post charge; underlying margin was 54%

2. **Middle**: RAG status tiles for each strategic initiative
3. **Bottom**: Two-column comparison of leading indicators (trending positive) vs. lagging indicators (trending negative)

---

### Actionable Insight

> **Management has earned credibility on operational execution but has not yet demonstrated ability to drive growth.** The consistent pattern of "beat and raise" on profitability metrics suggests conservative guidance methodology — the board can trust near-term financial targets.
>
> **However, the RED status on acquisition and growth should trigger heightened scrutiny.** When Peter Stern presents in Q2 FY26 (Feb 2026), demand specific KPIs:
> - What is the target LTV/CAC ratio? (Currently undisclosed; long-term target is 2-3x)
> - What gross additions level is required to stabilize subscriber base?
> - What is the expected payback period on new hardware customers?
>
> **Board Monitoring Recommendation**: Establish a "subscriber floor threshold" — the minimum subscriber count that maintains business viability. Current trajectory suggests ~2.6M by end FY26. If subscriber count approaches 2.5M, trigger a strategic review.

---

### Speaker Notes

The execution scorecard tells a clear story: management can cut costs and improve margins, but hasn't yet proven they can grow the business. Over five consecutive quarters, the team has beaten guidance on profitability metrics, often by substantial margins. The Q1 FY26 result was particularly notable — free cash flow came in at $67 million versus an expectation of slightly negative, a swing of roughly $75-80 million. This wasn't luck; it reflects structural improvements in the cost base and working capital management.

However, the subscriber trajectory should concern the board. The base has declined from a peak of ~3.0 million in FY23 to 2.73 million today, and management is guiding to 2.64-2.67 million by end of Q2 FY26. The pricing changes announced in October 2025 are causing a temporary spike in churn, which management expects to normalize — but the underlying trend of declining gross additions remains unaddressed.

The leading indicators from Peter Stern's initiatives — engagement up 50%, Club Peloton adoption, improved satisfaction scores — are genuinely encouraging. But these are quality metrics, not quantity metrics. The key question for the February earnings call is whether these improvements can translate into acquisition growth, or whether Peloton is simply getting better at retaining a shrinking base.

# SLIDE 3: Strategic Outlook — What Should the Board Do Next?

## **Key Message**
Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent bet on extending member lifetime value and diversifying revenue streams beyond hardware sales. Early execution signals are positive, but the strategy carries material risks. The board should monitor three specific metrics as "trip wires" that would trigger strategy reassessment.

---

### Peter Stern's Strategic Framework (Since Jan 2025)

**Company Purpose**: "Empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy"

**The "Magic Formula"**: Premium equipment + AI software + world-class instructors + supportive community

---

### Key Opportunities (Probability-Weighted Assessment)

| Opportunity | Probability | Impact | Time Horizon | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Content licensing expansion** | Medium-High | High | FY26-27 | Lululemon deal, Hyatt partnership established; model proven |
| **B2B/Commercial via Precor** | Medium | High | FY26-28 | Unified commercial unit created; Precor provides global infrastructure |
| **International expansion** | Low-Medium | High | FY27+ | Currently 6 markets; Precor in 60+ but integration complex |
| **LTV extension through engagement** | Medium-High | Medium | FY26-27 | Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Teams showing early traction |
| **Hardware margin improvement to 20%** | Medium | Medium | FY27+ | Long-term target; currently at 13.6%, improving |

---

### Key Risks (With Mitigation Assessment)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Quality |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Subscriber base erosion** | High | Critical | 🟡 Weak — initiatives focused on retention, not acquisition |
| **Tariff exposure** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — diversified supply chain; $45M impact absorbed in FY26 guidance |
| **Pricing elasticity** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 Moderate — Oct 2025 increases causing temporary churn spike; watching closely |
| **Market saturation** | High | High | 🟡 Weak — connected fitness TAM uncertain; Peloton strategy assumes premium segment defensible |
| **Execution complexity** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Strong — Peter Stern has simplified strategy to four pillars; comp aligned |

### FY26 Guidance (Updated Nov 2025)

| Metric | FY26 Guidance | Change vs. FY25 |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Total Revenue | $2.4-2.5B | -2% at midpoint |
| Adj. EBITDA | $425-475M | +12% at midpoint |
| Free Cash Flow | ≥$250M | -23% but from exceptionally strong FY25 |
| Gross Margin | 52% | +110 bps |
| Net Churn | Flat YoY | Stabilization target |
| Operating Income | **Positive (full year)** | First time in company history |

---

### Visualization Recommendation
**Risk-opportunity matrix** with probability on Y-axis and impact on X-axis:
- Upper right quadrant (high probability, high impact): Subscriber erosion, market saturation
- Upper left (low probability, high impact): International expansion
- Lower right (high probability, medium impact): LTV extension, content licensing
- Include management's mitigation quality as color coding

---

### Actionable Insight: Three Board-Level Recommendations

#### **Recommendation 1: Monitor Content Licensing Revenue as Leading Indicator**
Content licensing (Lululemon, Hyatt, etc.) represents Peloton's ability to monetize its content platform beyond hardware sales — the core premise of the strategic pivot. This metric is not currently broken out separately in financials.

> **Board Action**: Request quarterly reporting on content licensing revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue. Establish a target (e.g., 10% by FY27) and flag any quarters where it declines.

---

#### **Recommendation 2: Establish Subscriber Floor Threshold**
The current profitability model depends on maintaining a subscriber base large enough to cover fixed costs. Management has not disclosed the minimum viable subscriber count.

> **Board Action**: Work with management to define a "subscriber floor" — the threshold below which the cost structure would need further adjustment. Estimate: ~2.3-2.5M subscribers. If projected trajectory approaches this floor, trigger formal strategic review.

---

#### **Recommendation 3: Demand Concrete Growth Metrics by Q2 FY26**
Peter Stern has articulated a compelling vision but has not provided quantified growth targets. The board should not accept another quarter of "inflection toward growth" language without supporting metrics.

> **Board Action**: In the February 2026 earnings review, require management to present:
> - Target gross additions by channel (direct, third-party retail, commercial)
> - Expected customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel
> - LTV/CAC ratio targets by customer segment
> - Timeline for revenue growth inflection (specific quarter, not "sometime in FY26")

---

### What Success Looks Like (12-Month Scorecard)

| Metric | RED Trigger | AMBER Watch | GREEN Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Ending Subscribers (Jun 2026) | <2.5M | 2.5-2.7M | >2.7M |
| Content Licensing as % Sub Revenue | <3% | 3-5% | >5% |
| Gross Additions (FY26) | Down >15% YoY | Down 5-15% | Flat or positive |
| Free Cash Flow | <$200M | $200-250M | >$250M |
| Churn (Full Year) | >1.8% | 1.6-1.8% | ≤1.6% |

---

### Speaker Notes

The strategic question facing Peloton is whether it can transition from a "stabilized decline" trajectory to a "sustainable growth" trajectory. Peter Stern's strategy represents a coherent approach to this challenge: extend the lifetime value of existing members through AI personalization and loyalty programs, while diversifying distribution through commercial/B2B channels and content licensing partnerships.

The early indicators are genuinely positive. Engagement is up 50% since October, Club Peloton has attracted over 500,000 participants, and member satisfaction scores have improved dramatically. The new Cross Training Series hardware has received positive reviews. These are the foundations for retention improvement.

However, the board should maintain appropriate skepticism about growth claims. Every initiative Peter Stern has announced is oriented toward making existing members more engaged and valuable — which is necessary but not sufficient for revenue growth. The company has not yet articulated a convincing plan to reverse the decline in new customer acquisition.

The three recommendations I've outlined are designed to give the board early warning signals if the strategy isn't working. Content licensing revenue is the clearest indicator of platform value beyond hardware. The subscriber floor establishes a boundary condition that would require strategic intervention. And demanding concrete growth metrics ensures management accountability.

If the February 2026 earnings call does not include quantified targets for acquisition and growth — with specific timelines and supporting unit economics — the board should consider whether the current strategy is capable of producing growth, or whether Peloton should be managed as a cash-generating business with a declining revenue trajectory.
