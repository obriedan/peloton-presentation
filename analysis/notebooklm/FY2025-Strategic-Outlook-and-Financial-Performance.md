### **2\. Q2 FY2025 Expectations**

For the second quarter, management provided specific ranges reflecting seasonal trends and increased marketing spend.

*   **Total Revenue:** "**$640 million to $660 million**," which reflects a sequential increase due to holiday hardware sales[[Source 5]](#src-5).

*   **Additional Efficiencies:** Management noted they are realizing some savings "faster than we anticipated" and finding "additional cost efficiency through **reductions to media spend** that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals"[[Source 8]](#src-8).

Any changes in these areas may affect our gross additions for paid connected fitness subscription across the fiscal year. Our full year guidance range for paid app subscriptions of 550,000 to 600,000, a 20,000 reduction versus our prior guidance reflects our decision to limit app media spend as we invest in product development to improve the member experience. Additionally, as we continue to improve our member experience, we see clear opportunities to improve engagement, which could result in favorability to churn for both connected fitness and app. While we are optimistic we can improve engagement through product and content innovation and evolving our marketing strategy, the timing of when we will start to see meaningful impact from these efforts is uncertain and, therefore, not reflected in our guidance.

Our primary focus for FY '25 is delivering our key financial results, which include total revenue, total gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. We are prioritizing these metrics, along with delivering free cash flow. Our FY '25 outlook for total revenue remains unchanged at $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, as well as our outlook for total gross margin, which remains unchanged at 49%. We are raising our FY '25 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $40 million to $240 million to $290 million, which reflects our continued improvement in profitability, largely due to gross margin expansion the operating cost savings we expect to achieve related to our previously announced cost restructuring plan and reduced media spend year over year.

We are also raising our free cash flow target to at least $125 million an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance, primarily from lower inventory production that we expect to create a greater working capital tailwind, as well as continued operating expense efficiencies. Following our Q1 free cash flow result of $11 million, we do expect to achieve positive free cash flow in all four quarters of the fiscal year. We expect to make meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet throughout FY '25 and beyond. And now I'd like to turn it back to Chris for some closing remarks.

Our Q2 FY '25 ending paid app subscription outlook of 560,000 to 580,000 reflects a sequential decrease of 12,000 subscribers at the midpoint, as a result of a decision to limit app media spend. Revenue guidance of $640 million to $660 million reflects a sequential increase of $64 million at the midpoint. As a result of these subscription trends, combined with an expected seasonal increase in hardware sales. Total gross margin guidance of 46.5% reflects an expected sequential decline in gross margin of 534 basis points as a result of a seasonal mix shift toward our connected fitness Product segment during the holiday sales period.

Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $30 million reflects a sequential decline of $91 million at the midpoint, mainly due to higher sales and marketing expenses as we increased media spend for the holiday season. Our full year FY '25 guidance reflects the expectation that hardware sales will decline year over year, as well as an expectation that average net monthly paid connected fitness churn will continue to increase modestly year over year and follow our historical seasonal pattern. Our full year guidance range for paid connected fitness subscriptions of $2.68 million to $2.75 million remains unchanged and reflects a broad range of outcomes. We will continue to refine our strategy to improve unit economics over the course of FY '25, which may include additional changes in pricing, promotional strategy, or other levers available to achieve our financial targets.

Overall, our first quarter performance reflects the progress we've made in rearchitecting our cost structure while maintaining our leadership position within the connected fitness category and the strength of our highly retentive, high gross margin subscription business. Next, I'd like to provide context on our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our guidance for Q2 FY '25 ending paid connected fitness subscriptions of 2.84 million to 2.86 million reflects a sequential decrease of 50,000 subscribers at the midpoint. We expect our average net monthly paid connected fitness churn rate to slightly improve sequentially in Q2.

Adjusted EBITDA was $116 million in the first quarter, which was $56 million above the high end of our guidance range and a $107 million improvement year over year.

We generated $11 million of free cash flow in the quarter, outperforming internal expectations and delivering our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $722 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.

At the same time, we delivered more content for the performance athlete segment, adding more 75-, 90-, and 120-minute classes in response to member interest in those options. I'm incredibly proud of the Peloton team for continuing to innovate across marketing, product, and content, while we significantly reduced costs in the business, the operational excellence that we're seeing from the team has made all of this possible. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Liz, who will take us through a review of our first quarter financial performance.

Liz Coddington -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Chris. First, I'd like to provide an update for how we are tracking against the cost restructuring plan we announced in May. As of the end of Q1, we have actioned all payroll-related changes that were assumed in the restructuring plan, which will deliver over $100 million of annualized run rate savings. We continue to make progress and benefit from all other nonpayroll-related savings.

Together with the payroll savings, we are still on track to deliver over $200 million of run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. And we are realizing some of these savings faster than we anticipated. Also, we're delivering additional cost efficiency through reductions to media spend that were not included in our $200 million restructuring goals. Now I'll spend a few minutes on our Q1 results.
