# <a id="src-main"></a> The Peter Stern Era: Peloton’s Strategic Evolution 2025

Based on the earnings transcripts, 8-K filings, and proxy statements from January 2025 through November 2025, Peter Stern’s strategic vision centers on evolving Peloton from a connected fitness company into a broader "fitness and wellness" ecosystem. His stated purpose for the company is to "**empower people to live fit, strong, long, and happy**"[[Source 1]](#src-1)[[Source 2]](#src-2).

To achieve this, Stern defined a "magic formula" comprising premium equipment, AI-powered software, world-class instructors, and a supportive community[[Source 3]](#src-3)[[Source 4]](#src-4). Since taking over as CEO on January 1, 2025, he has implemented changes across four primary strategic pillars:

### 1\. Improve Member Outcomes through Innovation

Stern’s strategy prioritizes holistic health outcomes over simple hardware sales, expanding into strength, mental wellness, and recovery.

*   **AI and Personalization (Peloton IQ):** Stern launched **Peloton IQ** in October 2025, an AI-powered personalized coach that uses data from wearables and class history to provide individual guidance and recommendations[[Source 5]](#src-5)[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **Hardware Overhaul (Cross Training Series):** In October 2025, Peloton released the **Cross Training Series** (Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row+). These devices feature swivel screens for floor workouts and, in the "Plus" line, advanced computer vision to count reps and correct form[[Source 3]](#src-3)\> <[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **Expansion into Wellness:**
    *   **Mental Fitness:** In September 2025, Peloton acquired **Breathwrk**, a subscription app for breathing exercises, integrating it into Peloton memberships[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).
    *   **Medical Partnerships:** Stern announced collaborations with the **Hospital for Special Surgery** for injury prevention content and **Respin Health** to study and support menopause[[Source 11]](#src-11).
*   **Software Apps:** Stern oversaw the scaling of the **Strength+ App** (launched December 2024), designed for gym-based strength training[[Source 12]](#src-12)[[Source 13]](#src-13). Conversely, the company **discontinued the sale of the Peloton Guide** hardware in July 2025, shifting focus to software-based tracking[[Source 8]](#src-8).

### 2\. Meet Members Everywhere (Expansion of Distribution)

Stern shifted the company’s distribution strategy to meet customers in physical retail spaces and commercial settings.

*   **Commercial Push (Pro Series):** He established a unified commercial business unit combining Peloton and Precor. This included launching the **Peloton Pro Series** (commercial-grade Bike+, Tread+, and Row+) for hotels and multi-family residences[[Source 8]](#src-8)[[Source 14]](#src-14).
*   **Retail Partnerships & Footprint:**
    *   **Micro-Stores:** Expanded from one to ten "micro-stores" in the U.S. by late 2025 to provide capital-efficient physical touchpoints[[Source 15]](#src-15).
    *   **Third-Party Retail:** Entered a partnership with **Johnson Fitness & Wellness** to place products in 100 retail locations and utilized **Costco** as a seasonal partner[[Source 15]](#src-15)[[Source 16]](#src-16).
    *   **Precor Integration:** Leveraged Precor’s infrastructure to handle installation and service for commercial clients[[Source 17]](#src-17).

### 3\. Make Members for Life (Deepening Connection)

To increase retention and lifetime value (LTV), Stern introduced gamification and loyalty mechanics.

*   **Club Peloton:** Launched a loyalty and recognition program in late 2025, where members unlock exclusive content and rewards based on engagement[[Source 18]](#src-18).
*   **Teams:** Introduced official instructor-led "Teams" (e.g., "Move for Life," "HYROX") to foster social connections and competition among members[[Source 16]](#src-16)[[Source 18]](#src-18).

### 4\. Operational Discipline and Financial Efficiency

Stern continued the restructuring efforts begun by his predecessors to ensure sustainable cash flow.

*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, Stern announced a new restructuring plan involving global headcount reductions to target at least **$100 million in run-rate savings** by the end of FY2026[[Source 19]](#src-19)[[Source 20]](#src-20).
*   **Pricing Adjustments:** He implemented monetization initiatives, including expert assembly fees and subscription price changes in late 2025, accepting a temporary increase in churn to improve long-term unit economics[[Source 21]](#src-21)[[Source 22]](#src-22).
*   **Executive Compensation Redesign:** For FY2026, the compensation structure for leadership was redesigned to heavily weight performance-based stock units (PSUs) and reduce cash salaries, aligning executive pay more aggressively with shareholder value and free cash flow targets[[Source 23]](#src-23)[[Source 24]](#src-24).

The Peloton team has made impressive progress over the last few quarters in putting the company on sound financial footing. Nonetheless, we have a tall hill to climb before we can demonstrate the impact of that virtuous cycle on member and revenue growth. So right now, our primary focus is on executing against and delivering our fiscal '25 financial and operating goals while we prepare to climb that tall hill in fiscal '26 and beyond. We'll share more about longer-term strategy as the calendar year progresses.

But today, I can share my perspective after one month of official duties at Peloton. Achieving the new purpose we've defined for ourselves empowering people to live fit, strong, long, and happy means we need to focus on innovation on new products and experiences that lead to even better outcomes for members, presence in more places, so we can meet members wherever they are. More ways to connect members with Peloton and our uniquely supportive community. And last but certainly not least, improved unit economics and the cost structure that's rightsized for our business.

Overview

Peloton is a leading global fitness and wellness company that empowers its Members to live fit, strong, long, and happy by providing fitness and wellness products and services they can use anytime, anywhere. We have a highly engaged community of nearly 6 million Members as of September 30, 2025, across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Austria. As a category innovator at the nexus of fitness and wellness, technology, and media, we deliver experiences through our world-renowned Instructors, premium hardware and innovative software, personalization, and extensive modalities and content formats. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, Peloton aims to scale across the markets in which it operates.

Throughout the quarter, the Peloton team was hard at work, setting the stage for our new chapter by innovating on every aspect of our magic formula of premium equipment, software powered by AI, world-class instructors and a deeply engaged community. In last quarter's remarks, I laid out Peloton's strategy. The first and most foundational part of that strategy is our commitment to improving member outcomes. To that end, on October 1, we simultaneously unveiled and began shipping the most significant product update in our history with an all-new equipment lineup, the Peloton Cross Training Series and the Peloton Pro series.

Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA guidance of $70 million to $85 million reflects a sequential increase of $19 million at the midpoint, mainly due to seasonally lower sales and marketing expenses following the holiday season. We are also raising our fiscal 2025 free cash flow target to at least $200 million, an increase of $75 million from our previous target. This reflects faster-than-expected improvement in operating expense reduction, a higher degree of confidence in full-year hardware sales performance following the holiday season, and inventory-related net working capital efficiencies. We expect to continue making meaningful progress in deleveraging our balance sheet through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

Before we open for Q&A, I'd like to hand it back to Peter to talk about what makes Peloton so special and gives us such optimism for the future.

Peter Stern -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Thanks, Liz. You and the team should be proud of the work you all accomplished in Q2. There are lots of companies that make fitness equipment, dozens of fitness apps, countless trainers, but there is only one Peloton. That's because we combine the best hardware, the best software, and the best human coaches with the world's most supportive community.

We've made several additional upgrades, including improvements in audio across the board and featuring sound by Sonos in our Plus line for a studio-like experience. On October 1, we also launched Peloton IQ, which gives every Peloton member a personalized coach regardless of whether they own our new Cross Training Series, our Original Series or work out with a Peloton app subscription. Peloton IQ uses AI to turn years of insights and data points, including your goals, class activity and health stats from wearable devices into personal training guidance. In so doing, Peloton IQ makes some of the benefits of personal training accessible to millions of people, providing individual insights and recommendations based on members' intentions, preferences, level of fitness and performance.

So let me start with the usage point. It's actually been really -- that's been really positive. So we mentioned earlier that we've had 500,000 of our members use Club Peloton already. We're also seeing more people taking workouts from our home screen, and let me explain why that matters. For a lot of our members, they kind of stay with the same old, same old. They go to the classes page, and go to their comfort zone. But when people are taking workouts from the home screen, it means that the recommendations that we're delivering with Peloton IQ are starting to hit home.

Our understanding of human health has progressed since Peloton took the world by storm with the introduction of the original bike. And today, we know that adults need to pursue a combination of cardio, strength and more to achieve their wellness goals. To that end, all Peloton products now feature advanced swivel screens, allowing members to easily transition between cardio and strength to complete floor workouts, including strength, yoga, Pilates and stretching. Our new Plus line includes an advanced computer vision movement tracking camera that counts your reps, corrects your form and offers weight suggestions in real time, along with voice control, enabling members to adjust weights, skip moves or pause their workout without touching a thing.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company’s Connected Fitness Products portfolio included the Original Series Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Row, Guide (discontinued as of July 2025), and various Precor products. In October 2025, the Company launched a refreshed portfolio of Connected Fitness Products called the Cross Training Series, including the Cross Training Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, and Row+. The Company continues to sell the refurbished Original Series Peloton Bike and Bike+. Additionally, the Company launched the Peloton Pro Series, a refresh of its portfolio of commercial-certified Peloton-branded products, which now include the Bike+ Pro, Tread+ Pro, and Row+ Pro.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Since launching the Cross Training Series and Peloton IQ, we've observed a favorable mix shift toward our more premium products, including a mix shift toward Tread sales and toward our Plus line of products, the latter of which we believe is driven by excitement around the advanced computer vision features. Beyond our work on cardio and strength, the trust we've built with our community gives us an opportunity to address an even broader array of wellness domains. In September, we acquired Breathwrk, an award-winning app specializing in breathing exercises, which have been shown to positively impact sleep, focus, blood pressure, heart rate variability, stress and anxiety. The Breathwrk subscription app makes mental fitness accessible to all, and now our members can enjoy Breathwrk as part of their All-Access or App+ subscriptions. We'll have more to share over time as we evolve in this important category.

We define a “Member” as any individual who has a Peloton account through a Paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a Paid App Subscription, inclusive of the Peloton App+, App One, Strength+, and Breathwrk Memberships (our “Peloton Apps”), and engages in one or more workouts in the trailing 12-month period. We define workout engagement as either (i) completing the lesser of 50% or 10 minutes of Instructor-led classes, Scenic, and Lanebreak workouts; (ii) at least 10 minutes of any activity tracking workout (such as “Just Ride”, “Just Run”, or “Just Row”) or Entertainment workout; (iii) at least 5 minutes of any Strength+ workout with 80% of sets marked complete; or (iv) completing a Breathwrk class.

We also announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the Hospital for Special Surgery, the world leader in orthopedics to offer Peloton members access to expert care for joint and muscle pain, injuries and orthopedic conditions. We've co-developed class collections with HSS medical experts, recently launching the first 5 on preventing some of the most common types of injuries. We're also committed to meeting members where they are in their life stages. In response to member demand, we started with menopause, a life stage that impacts the majority of our members at some point in their lives. We're extremely proud of our partnership with Respin Health, founded by Halle Berry to revolutionize menopause care with an integrated holistic approach, and have just launched a study with over 1,000 women to measure the benefits of targeted movement strategies and other evidence-based lifestyle interventions. These findings will power our evolving evidence-based exercise programming and menopause support.

On the cardio side, we continue to elevate Tread, thanks to our marketing efforts, which enabled us to exceed our Tread portfolio sales goals and achieve higher new subscription attach rates on Tread and Tread+ sales year over year in Q2. And with the release of our 10K training program in Q2, Peloton now offers training for all major race distances. And already over 300,000 members have trained for a running race with Peloton. We're also seeing the positive impact of innovative new software features like Pace Targets, which offer running instruction with personalized intensity levels rather than treadmill speed.

Nearly 60% of our members who take instructor-led running workouts on our Tread products are using Pace Targets, and our members running paces are improving as a result. Another way to improve our business is to meet members in more places. For example, at the gym. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app offering non-class strength training programs with audio guidance from expert coaches and a custom workout generator.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

Meeting Members in More Places Meeting Members in more places is another way to improve our service and grow our business. In December, we launched Strength+, a new app designed for gym-based strength workouts with audio guidance from expert coaches, as well as a custom strength workout generator. It reached over 220,000 monthly active users in the three months ended December 31, 2024, the vast majority of whom were existing All-Access Members, and represents another value-add for our Members.

Our commercial business unit continues to show strong performance and is an area in which we are also innovating. The new Peloton Pro series offers a complete lineup of Peloton equipment for commercial environments such as hotel gyms and multi-residential buildings, and includes the Tread+ Pro, Peloton's first ever commercial treadmill. And Precor launched its new commercial Tread, the Breakaway. This new slat belt treadmill includes a sled-style push mode, cadence coach and a new console design. Peloton also recently became the primary fitness partner powering Utah City, a 700-acre mixed-use development outside of Salt Lake City. And now every residential building in Utah City will feature a Peloton space that includes several pieces of Peloton equipment and accessories for residents.

The second part of our strategy is to meet members everywhere. We have made great progress on this front over the past few weeks. We now have 10 micro stores in the U.S., up from 1 prior to Q1. And we also announced a new retail partnership with Johnson Fitness & Wellness, the nation's largest independent fitness retailer with 100 locations across the U.S. We now have a physical retail presence in 46 states, while in Australia, we launched a retail presence in 11 franchise locations throughout the country. Our expanded retail footprint positions us well for the holiday season, providing opportunities for consumers to test and experience our new innovations.

In Q2, it reached over 220,000 monthly active users. The vast majority of whom were existing All-Access members. Third-party retail enables us to meet new members in places where they already shop. Our new seasonal partner with Costco in the U.S.

drove more Bike+ unit sales than any other third-party retail partner, enabling us to meet many new members at a retailer they trust. And we remain focused on meeting more new members across the globe. We are encouraged by the performance of international hardware sales in Q2 alongside our continued growth in Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions from international markets. Turning to the connections between Peloton's members with the company and with each other.

As you may know, Peloton is named after the pack of cyclists who ride closely together to reduce their collective resistance. So we are focused on deepening the connections our 6 million members have with each other and with Peloton. In September, we launched Teams, which enables members to share workouts and compete in challenges. 70,000 Teams have been created since launch.

# <a id="src-17"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 17)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Bill, you talked also about a third point I'd raise, which is international. Peloton is only in 6 countries right now, but Precor is in over 60 countries. So that opens up opportunities for Peloton to enter these new markets in ways that build on existing distribution and relationships that we've already got, starting with B2B. So strategically, we're in a great place. It's just an execution challenge from here, and you can already see us executing on this. For example, Precor now provides all the installation and service for Peloton commercial locations, including hotels. Last month, we announced Precor's first slated tread, the Breakaway with a new smarter, more powerful screen and Peloton's first-ever commercial tread initially for hospitality and for multi-dwelling units was launched as part of the new Peloton Pro line. So you add all of this up, I feel great about where we are with our commercial business unit, and I'm confident we're going to be able to bring this together and deliver an industry-leading set of products and solutions on behalf of commercial clients.

# <a id="src-18"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 18)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

The third part of our strategy is to make members for life. Celebrating achievement is crucial for sticking with any program. So last month, we launched Club Peloton, our first loyalty and recognition program. As members engage with our platform, they progress through levels from bronze to legend, unlocking exclusive content recognition and rewards. Already more than 500,000 members have engaged with Club Peloton. On October 1, we also introduced official Peloton teams led by Peloton instructors, including Move for Life, Menopause, HYROX and Cross Training. These teams provide a forum for members to connect, discuss goals and learn from each other and from experts, further elevating Peloton's community. Since October 1, engagement with teams is up nearly 50%.

4\. Restructuring

In February 2022, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring plan (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in April 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded and collectively with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”).

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to continue to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. Our actions under our previous restructuring plans announced in February 2022 (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in May 2024 (the “2024 Restructuring Plan”) have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan. The 2022, 2024, and 2025 plans, taken together, are referred to as the “Restructuring Plans.” The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

Ultimately, all these strategic initiatives, product innovation, wellness expansion and new distribution are underpinned by the fourth part of our strategy, our commitment to operational discipline and business excellence. Our full year guidance announced in August included targeted initiatives to improve monetization, such as the introduction of expert assembly fees. These were implemented within the quarter and exceeded our expectations. At the same time, our cost reduction plans remain on track. Perhaps most important, we remain confident in our ability to inflect toward revenue growth as the fiscal year progresses, building on the actions we took in Q1 and on October 1. We continue to monitor and respond to evolving tariff policies and broader changes in the macro environment and consumer spending. While those external factors are real, our focus remains on execution and being the best fitness and wellness partner to our members.

# <a id="src-22"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 22)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.

### REDESIGN OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR FISCAL 2026

OVERVIEW In September 2025, the Compensation Committee approved a comprehensive redesign of our executive compensation program for Fiscal 2026. The Compensation Committee believes the redesign will strengthen our commitment to our pay for performance philosophy and will further align certain key components of the program with prevailing market practice among our compensation peer group. The redesign is applicable to our named executive officers and our leadership team members more broadly, other than Mr. Stern and certain leadership team members who joined the Company in Fiscal 2025, who already have compensation arrangements in place that are designed in accordance with the new compensation philosophy.
