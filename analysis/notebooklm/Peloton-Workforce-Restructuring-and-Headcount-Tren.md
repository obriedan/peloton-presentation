**Key Observation:** The decline in core Peloton staff is significant. While the FY2023 count (3,584) excluded Precor, the FY2025 count (2,656) _includes_ Precor, indicating that the reduction in legacy Peloton staff is steeper than the headline numbers suggest.

### **Specific Restructuring Actions**

The Proxy Statements and ESG reports highlight three major restructuring phases aimed at reducing fixed costs and improving cash flow.

*   **2022 Restructuring Plan:** Initiated to realign operational focus, this plan involved "getting the right people in the right roles" and stabilizing cash flow[[Source 5]](#src-5). The ESG report noted that the company provided support to team members impacted by this restructuring, including cash compensation, extended healthcare, and career support services[[Source 6]](#src-6).
*   **2024 Restructuring Plan:** Announced in May 2024, this plan aimed to position the company for sustained positive free cash flow. It included a **global headcount reduction of approximately 15%**, which impacted roughly **400 team members**[[Source 7]](#src-7)[[Source 8]](#src-8).
*   **2025 Restructuring Plan:** In August 2025, the company announced a new plan involving further "reduction in global headcount" to achieve at least **$100 million in run-rate cost savings** by the end of Fiscal 2026[[Source 9]](#src-9)[[Source 10]](#src-10).

### **Workforce Strategy & Support**

Despite the reductions, the ESG and Proxy reports emphasize a strategy of "talent density" and support for the remaining workforce:

*   **Compensation:** The company completed pay equity studies in FY2023 and FY2025, finding no statistically significant pay gaps based on gender or race[[Source 11]](#src-11)[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Wages:** Peloton offers a starting hourly rate of no less than $19 for non-sales hourly roles in the US[[Source 12]](#src-12).
*   **Engagement:** In FY2025, the company reported an engagement score of 77% favorable and an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 74%, an increase of 12 points from the prior year[[Source 13]](#src-13).

BUSINESS UPDATE

We entered Fiscal 2023 hard at work on the restructuring plan that we initiated in February 2022 to realign our operational focus to support our multi-year growth, enable us to scale the business, and facilitate improved costs (the “Restructuring Plan”). At that time, we had three primary short-term goals for the business: stabilizing cash flow, getting the right people in the right roles, and returning to growth.

Our Fiscal 2023 results reflect the substantial progress that we have made re-architecting our business in pursuit of these goals. We achieved positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, excluding the costs of a one-time legal settlement, which was an important milestone in rightsizing the cost structure of our business. Our Fiscal 2023 summary results were as follows:

On April 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). We believe that the 2024 Restructuring Plan will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the Company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its Member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business. The 2024 Restructuring Plan includes: (i) a reduction in global headcount by approximately 15%, which impacted roughly 400 Peloton team members; and (ii) continued closures of our retail locations. We expect the majority of the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be implemented by the end of fiscal 2025.

In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.

As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.

Our commitments Our work

Maintain 100% pay equity across gender and race/ethnicity Each year, we will conduct a global pay equity study across gender and race/ethnicity and address pay gaps.

In FY23, we commissioned a third-party consultant to conduct a global pay equity study Based on the study’s results, we adjusted base pay for a small number of team members to address gaps.2

100% of all interviewers required to undergo Hiring@Peloton training This training includes bias mitigation. Additional talent acquisition efforts include evaluating all job descriptions to reduce the risk of biased language, and leveraging consistent sourcing tools to ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

We continually evaluate our compensation rates for all team members. We offer a starting hourly rate of no less than $19 for all hourly non-sales-commissioned roles, and equally competitive rates for equivalent roles in all other markets where we have hourly team members.

We remain strongly committed to pay equity, and in FY25, we completed our third pay equity study to identify any significant gaps based on FY24 pay levels. Our latest study did not reveal any meaningful pay gaps.

Engaging our people Since we know that people are more likely to perform at their best when they are engaged, we listen carefully to our team members, including through our annual global team member experience survey, The Input. This provides a consistent company-wide forum for team members to contribute their perspectives, in turn giving Peloton’s leadership visibility into team member sentiment.

In FY25, 91% of our team members completed our team member experience survey. The results demonstrated significant progress on several important metrics compared to FY24, including a rise of 12 points in our Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) to 74%.
