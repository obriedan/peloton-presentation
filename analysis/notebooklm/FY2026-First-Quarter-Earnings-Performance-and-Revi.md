# <a id="src-main"></a> FY2026 First Quarter Earnings Performance and Revised Outlook

Based on the **Q1 FY2026 earnings call transcript** (dated November 6, 2025), management focused primarily on the results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 and the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.

The transcript does not contain a retrospective comparison of **FY2025 full-year results** against the guidance given at the start of FY2025, as that period had closed in the previous quarter. However, management provided extensive details regarding their **Q1 FY2026 performance** against guidance and updated their **FY2026 full-year outlook**.

### 1\. Q1 FY2026 Performance vs. Guidance

Management reported that the company exceeded expectations on most metrics for the first quarter of FY2026.

*   **Total Revenue:** **Beat.** Reported 551million ∗ ∗,\\, outperformingthehighendoftheguidancerangeby ∗ ∗**6 million**[[Source 1]](#src-1).
*   **Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions:** **Beat.** Ended with **2.732 million**, exceeding the high end of guidance by **2,000**[[Source 2]](#src-2).
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** **Beat.** Reported 118million ∗ ∗,\\, whichwas ∗ ∗**18 million above** the high end of the guidance range[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Free Cash Flow:** **Beat.** Generated **$67 million**, which management noted was "significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow"[[Source 3]](#src-3).
*   **Total Gross Margin:** **Missed.** Reported **51.5%**, which was **50 basis points below** the guidance of 52%. Management attributed this miss to a specific one-time charge: "Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs"[[Source 4]](#src-4).

### 2\. New Guidance Provided for FY2026

In the Q1 FY2026 call, management **raised** their full-year guidance for Profitability (EBITDA), Gross Margin, and Free Cash Flow, while maintaining their Revenue outlook.

We ended the quarter with 542,000 ending paid app subscriptions, inclusive of subscriptions from our acquisition of Breathwrk. Total revenue was $551 million in Q1, comprising $152 million of Connected Fitness products revenue and $398 million of subscription revenue, outperforming the high end of our guidance range by $6 million. Outperformance relative to guidance was primarily driven by Connected Fitness products revenue from higher-than-expected hardware sales of both Peloton and Precor products. Connected Fitness products revenue decreased $7 million or 5% year-over-year, driven by lower equipment sales and deliveries, partially offset by a mix toward higher-priced products.

Liz Coddington Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Peter. I want to begin with our first quarter financial results in which we exceeded the high end of our guidance on most key metrics. We ended the first quarter with 2.732 million Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, reflecting a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Q1 is typically a seasonally lower quarter for hardware sales and seasonally higher quarter for churn. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 2,000, driven by higher-than-expected gross additions. Connected Fitness gross additions outperformed our expectations due to higher unit sales of our Connected Fitness products in both first-party and third-party retail channels. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn was 1.6%, an improvement of 20 basis points both year-over-year and 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Adjusted EBITDA was $118 million in Q1, which was a $2 million or 2% improvement year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our guidance range. To note, the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs was not added back to adjusted EBITDA. We generated $67 million of free cash flow in Q1, an increase of $57 million year-over-year, significantly outperforming our prior expectation for slightly negative cash flow in the quarter. Free cash flow benefited from tariff-related favorability associated with both lower-than-expected tariff rates and delayed timing for certain tariffs going into effect, lower operating costs associated with realizing indirect cost savings faster than anticipated, revenue favorability and other smaller impacts.

## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Subscription revenue decreased $28 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, lower content licensing revenue and lower ending paid app subscriptions, partly offset by used equipment activation fee revenue, which was introduced in late August of fiscal 2025. Total gross profit was $284 million in Q1, a decrease of $20 million or 7% year-over-year. Total gross margin was 51.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points below our guidance of 52%. Total gross margin was negatively impacted by a $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs this quarter, in addition to $3 million we accrued in the prior quarter, representing a total estimated impact of $16.5 million. Excluding this $13.5 million charge in Q1, total gross margin would have been 54% or 200 basis points above our Q1 guidance.

Next, I'd like to share context for our financial outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. Our full year fiscal 2026 revenue outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion is unchanged from what we provided last quarter and reflects a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year at the midpoint. Our recently announced changes to subscription pricing were incorporated into our previous full year outlook. And so far, the impact of those changes has been in line with our expectations. We are pleased that our members continue to see the value in their Peloton membership and the recently added benefits like Peloton IQ, Club Peloton, Breathwrk and more.

# <a id="src-6"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 6)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

As we noted last quarter, our full year guidance anticipates an inflection toward growth during certain quarters within the fiscal year. Our Q2 revenue outlook of $665 million to $685 million reflects this expectation with a slight increase of 0.2% year-over-year at the midpoint and an increase of 23% quarter-over-quarter as a result of seasonally higher equipment sales and recent pricing changes. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for total gross margin to 52%, which is an increase of 100 basis points from our prior guidance and an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable tariff rates relative to our prior full year guidance as policy continues to evolve, a favorable mix of sales toward higher-margin products and our continued focus on driving cost efficiency to our supply chain. These tailwinds are partially offset by the accrual for the Bike+ seat post inventory impact in Q1.

# <a id="src-7"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 7)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Q2 total gross margin is expected to be roughly 49%, down 250 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to an expected seasonally higher mix of Connected Fitness products revenue. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to $425 million to $475 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million from our prior guidance and an improvement of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint, driven by favorable gross profit and operating expenses, reflecting our expectation for realizing cost savings faster than previously anticipated. To note, we are increasing our full year guidance by $25 million, notwithstanding the $13.5 million accrual for Bike+ seat post inventory costs in Q1.

# <a id="src-8"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 8)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Generating meaningful free cash flow remains a top priority. We are raising our full year fiscal 2026 minimum free cash flow target by $50 million to at least $250 million, reflecting the benefit of lower tariffs, both from lower rates and later-than-expected implementation timing and our progress on realizing indirect cost savings sooner. This target reflects our expectations for a roughly $45 million impact to free cash flow as a result of tariff exposure, which remains a dynamic situation that may change in the future. Overall, our guidance for Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year reflects continued improvement in profitability and progress toward revenue growth. We still expect to achieve the important milestone of positive operating income on a full year basis in fiscal 2026.

# <a id="src-9"></a>Source: q1 2026 earnings call transcript.md (Citation 9)



## [Main Content](#src-main) 

Our Q2 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $75 million reflects an increase of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint, but a decrease of 45% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally higher marketing spend in Q2. Our Q2 guidance for ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions of 2.64 million to 2.67 million reflects a decrease of 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Average net monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription churn is expected to increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to an increase in subscription cancellations and pauses following our pricing changes announced on October 1. However, our guidance reflects an expectation that our net churn rate will be flat year-over-year in full year fiscal 2026. We also expect gross additions to decrease year-over-year as a result of an expected year-over-year decrease in hardware sales.
