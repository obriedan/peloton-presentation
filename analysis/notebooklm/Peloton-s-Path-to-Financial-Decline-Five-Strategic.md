# <a id="src-main"></a> Peloton's Path to Financial Decline: Five Strategic Failures

Based on the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Risk Factors sections of the Annual Reports (Form 10-K) for Fiscal Years 2022 through 2024, Peloton management identified the following five primary factors as the causes of the company's financial difficulties.

### 1\. Inability to Accurately Forecast Post-Pandemic Demand

Management consistently identified the extreme difficulty in forecasting consumer behavior following the COVID-19 pandemic as a root cause of financial strain. The company scaled its operations assuming pandemic-era growth would persist, leading to significant misalignment when demand normalized.

*   **Management Quote:** "Fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business."[[Source 1]](#src-1)
*   **Management Quote:** "We have had significant difficulty in forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance."[[Source 1]](#src-1),[[Source 2]](#src-2)

### 2\. Excess Inventory and Supply Chain Commitments

Directly resulting from the forecasting challenges mentioned above, Peloton faced severe inventory gluts. The company had committed to long-term supply agreements and built up stock to meet anticipated demand that did not materialize, forcing them to write down inventory value and incur storage costs.

*   **Management Quote:** "Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand has resulted in, and may continue to result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices."[[Source 3]](#src-3)
*   **Management Quote:** "Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue... increased... primarily driven by increased inventory reserves... related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use."[[Source 4]](#src-4)

### 3\. Product Safety Issues and Recalls (Tread+ and Bike Seat Post)

Operational and financial momentum was severely impacted by safety recalls, specifically regarding the Tread+ (May 2021) and the original Bike seat post (May 2023). These recalls resulted in halted sales, expensive retrofits, returns, legal costs, and reputational damage.

*   **Management Quote:** "The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, brand reputation, and business."[[Source 5]](#src-5)
*   **Management Quote:** "We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings... related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that... could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention... and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs."[[Source 6]](#src-6)

### 4\. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Inflation

Management identified external economic pressures as a significant factor reducing consumer discretionary spending. Rising inflation increased the company's component and logistics costs while simultaneously reducing the purchasing power of their target consumers.

*   **Management Quote:** "Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect."[[Source 7]](#src-7)
*   **Management Quote:** "Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses... if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases."[[Source 8]](#src-8)

### 5\. Market Saturation and Intense Competition

As the connected fitness market matured, Peloton faced challenges regarding market saturation and intense competition from both digital apps and traditional gyms reopening. Management noted that the rapid growth phase of the industry had slowed, making customer acquisition more difficult and costly.

*   **Management Quote:** "The connected fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain."[[Source 9]](#src-9)
*   **Management Quote:** "We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps."[[Source 10]](#src-10)

Our financial profile has been characterized by strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, yields an attractive LTV for our Connected Fitness Subscriptions well in excess of our CAC. Maintaining an attractive LTV/CAC ratio is a primary goal of our customer acquisition strategy.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Update and Recent Developments As we have previously disclosed, forecasting for our business during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in its more recent stages, has proven to be very challenging. While we have been able to grow more than we anticipated just two years ago, fluctuations in demand and supply that we have been navigating during this time period led us to grow our operations beyond what we believe is currently best suited to our business. Although our belief in the positive long-term outlook for Connected Fitness remains unchanged, the long-term cost demands of our business require us to recalibrate our near-term expectations. Additionally, while demand for our Connected Fitness Products has continued to strongly outpace pre-pandemic levels, we have had significant difficulty in _forecasting near-term consumer demand and, as a result, our expected near-term operating performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operating results have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.”_

inventory, we may be unable to renegotiate our agreements with existing suppliers or partners on mutually acceptable terms and may be prevented from fully utilizing firm purchase commitments. Although in certain instances our agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers or partners. In addition, we may deem it necessary or advisable to renegotiate agreements with our supply partners in order to scale our inventory with demand. Disputes with our supply partners regarding our agreements could result in litigation, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs as well as disruption to our supply chain and require management’s attention. Further, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain _circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings. See “— We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business.” Conversely, if we_ underestimate consumer demand, our suppliers and manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements or we may be subject to higher costs in order to secure the necessary _production capacity. See “— Increases in component costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.” An inability to meet consumer demand and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers could result in reputational harm and damaged customer_ relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased $196.9 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased inventory reserves in the amount of $222.1 million primarily related to excess inventory we do not expect to sell above cost and write-downs of raw materials that we estimate would have no future use as a result of our restructuring activities, costs of $169.0 million associated with Precor-branded commercial products, and increased Tread costs of $137.7 million, primarily driven by the launch of Tread in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by fewer deliveries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members

_Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation._

We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties, or may arise from upgrades or changes to hardware that we or our third-party manufacturing partners may make in the ordinary course of a product’s lifecycle. Actual or perceived defects may not be identified until after a product is in market. Any defects could impact our customer experience, tarnish our brand reputation or make our products and services unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and/or personal injury. We may also become subject to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. For example, we have received reports of injuries associated with our Tread+ product, one of which led to the death of a child. As a result of the aforementioned injuries associated with these reported Tread+ incidents, in April 2021, the CPSC unilaterally issued a warning to consumers about the safety hazards associated with the Tread+. While we do not agree with all of the assertions in the CPSC’s warning, in May 2021 we initiated a voluntary recall of our Tread+ product in collaboration with the CPSC. The CPSC is currently investigating the matter and in August 2022 we were notified by the CPSC that the agency staff believes we failed to meet our statutory obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act and intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties. The recall, the possibility that the CPSC or other regulators could assess penalties or fines against us, and the risk that the CPSC or we could determine to recall any other product now or in the future, may adversely impact our operating results, brand reputation, and business. In connection with the voluntary recall of the Tread+, we developed and released additional safety features, such as a passcode to protect against unauthorized use, and we are working to develop additional physical hardware to further enhance the safety of the product. If we are unable to develop a product solution to further enhance the safety of our Tread+ product, we may not be able to sell that product for a significant period of time, if ever, and may face substantial costs associated with the development of such features and implementation of the recall. In addition to the CPSC investigation, we are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings related to the Tread+ recall and other matters that, regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations, and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, the occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations, recalls, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if Members or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products are injured. Even if injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur expenses to

We are presently subject to class action litigation, private personal injury claims and other regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations related to the Tread+ and Bike recalls and other matters that, regardless of their merits, could harm our reputation, divert management’s attention from our operations, and result in substantial legal fees, judgments, fines, penalties, and other costs. Given that such proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Furthermore, the occurrence of real or perceived defects in any of our products, now or in the future, could result in additional negative publicity, regulatory investigations, recalls, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if Members or others who use or purchase our Connected Fitness Products are injured. Even if injuries are not the result of any defects, if they are perceived to be, we may incur _expenses to defend or settle any claims or government inquiries and our brand and reputation may be harmed. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the section titled “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K._

_An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and services._

Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary conditions, and other factors such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit and spending power, levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions and fluctuations. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. For example, in more recent quarters, we have experienced reduced consumer demand, partially contributing to a decrease in Connected Fitness Products revenue relative to prior year periods. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

_Inflation Risk_ As a result of inflationary conditions, there have been and may continue to be additional pressures on the ongoing increases in supply chain and logistics costs, materials costs, and labor costs. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have recently experienced the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, or economic pressures.

_The connected fitness market is relatively new and, if the general market and specific demand for our products and services does not resume growth, or fails to grow as much as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected._

The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new and grew rapidly over the last several years, and it is uncertain whether it will resume high levels of growth and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt our products and services. We have had to educate consumers about our products and services through significant investment and provide quality content that is superior to the content and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any, and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will develop or be sustained at current levels, that the public’s interest in connected fitness and wellness will continue, or that our products and services will be widely adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and services do not achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.

_We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors._

Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that compete with ours.
